Polling is not sufficient because some kernel parts may be
alive even if the responder of the polling is dead.  We want
to notify the failure after stopping other CPUs.

Notifying from second kernel needs to wait for the kernel
booted up and device initialization if needed, and this
is not applicable if we want to do fast switchover.

Notifying just before second kernel, as Eric stated, is
one of the reliable option although we can't do complicate
things there.  For example, we can notify the failure by
writing some specific I/O registers in purgatory codes
provided by kexec command.  Since the purgatory codes are
currently embedded into kexec command, so we might need to
modify the mechanism to be pluggable because how to notify
will differ among vendors.

Anyway, this is the case of switchover use case.  If we want
to save minimal information before kdump, notifiers or
kmsg_dump() can be used.

I think it depends on what callback is used.  Most of panic
notifiers just do memory copy or I/O register access.
Of course, there are relatively complicate notifiers too,
and I'm preparing patch sets for hardening for that case.
