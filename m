Yes, you're right.

I think your original insight is correct, it can be complicated to
translate between pages and the structures used for the
fillrect/copyarea/imageblit operations.

hecubafb uses pages. oh wait, I see, I had posted a patch to support
pages but I never got it merged. I'll put that on the todo list.

Agreed.

Yes, this sounds reasonable.

I think I agree that conversion routines would start getting messy and
require hardware specific knowledge in which case, I think we might as
well leave it for the drivers to do.

Sounds like a reasonable plan. However, I think you're planning to do
page support in sh_mobile and hecubafb should be page based so that
would indicate there won't be any full frame drivers in the long term,
right? That said, I think its still valuable to have that code to make
that a possible option.

Thanks,
