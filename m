I assume you also require a reg to be able to poke the MMIO registers.

And an interrupt-controller annotation.

The example has a series of interrupts. How many do you expect, and what
do they logically correspond to (are they all equivalent, does one
signal errrors, etc)? Are they required or optional?

This is a useless description.

What are "resource allocation properties"?

Do you always expect "renesas,irqc" to be in the list?

As mentioned above, these were not described at all.

Thanks,
