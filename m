    I don't quite understand what's so strange about that. IMO, the device 
node properties are designed to carry the board specific info.

    Hm, isn't WP a read-only signal by design?

    Yes, I'd agree to that but I can't agree that preferring GPIO to the 
native WP signal is the only sane way.

    I don't think the legacy code handles CD correctly. The driver doesn't 
ever read the native CD signal, it expects CD to be always implemented via 
GPIO while the legacy code doesn't pass the GPIO to the driver.
