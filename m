Subject: [PATCH v4 00/11] CCF support for Renesas r7s72100

This series moves the r7s72100 platfrom from the legacy clock implementation to
the common clock framework.

This series has been tested with the renesas-devel-v3.15-rc2-20140428 tag.
If you want to boot into a console, you have a runtime dependency [1].

Changes since V4:

* only use dt alias for scif2

Changes since V3:

* rebased and tested against latest renesas/devel-tag
* using the new "clock-indices" binding
* reordered patches to skip the workaround entry for scif2
* moved serial aliases from the dtsi to the board file
  (and kept the numbering according to the legacy board code)
* updated my email-address

The workaround in the last patch could be avoided once the DT patches for MTU2
are available. Or we include the patch right now and clean the little bit up
later in an incremental fashion. Please apply.

Thanks,

   Wolfram
