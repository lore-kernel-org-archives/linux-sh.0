This looks like a very interesting method, and is similar to the "Kconfig
fragments" that a lot of people are using.

However I'm not sure we can replace the multi_v7_defconfig with it, the
main problem I see with that is that it can get unpredictable when
changes are done to one of the inputs. I'd rather keep the multi_v7_defconfig
in some form (possibly extend it to v6) and use fragments for some specialized
variation (v6-smp, v7, v7-lpae, ...).

Yes, this looks like very interesting work. We won't be able to use it
for all cases, in particular for distro kernels that are meant to run
on a large number of machines that don't all have dts files in the kernel,
but it should simplify the workflow for a lot of embedded use cases.
