Subject: [PATCH v2] ARM: shmobile: dts: koelsch: Fix flash partition label and size

Update the size and names of flash partitions to match the
expectations of the loader which are as follows:

"loader"---0x0000_0000-0x0008_0000 [loader program (readonly)]
"user"  ---0x0008_0000-0x0060_0000 [U-Boot + bootargs + dt + uImage (readonly)]
"flash" ---0x0060_0000-0x0400_0000 [filesystem and free (read/write)]

["user"'s assumed breakdown]
U-boot       (0x0008_0000-0x000c_0000) 256KiB
bootargs     (0x000c_0000-0x0010_0000) 256KiB
Device tree  (0x0010_0000-0x0014_0000) 256KiB
zImage       (0x0014_0000-0x0060_0000) 4.75MiB

v2
* As suggested by Geert Uytterhoeven
  - Break out U-boot and bootargs into separate areas within the user
    partition description in the changelog
  - Refer to zImage rather than uImage in the changelog
* As suggested by Sergei Shtylyov
  - Correct base address of partition nodes to match the base address of
    their register

This replaces a patch that I previously posted, "shmobile: koelsch: Fix
flash partition label and size in device tree", which has the same aim but
does so for an older version of the loader which to my knowledge is not
found in the wild.

I plan to post a similar patch for Lager if this one goes well.

I have been informed that the flash layout should also be the same
for Alt (which currently does not have flash in its dts file in mainline).
