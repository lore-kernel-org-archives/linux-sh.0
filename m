Thank you.

Simon will need a stable branch with these three patches that he can merge in 
his tree. If you could apply the patches to a branch directly on top of a 
mainline tag (I think you're currently based on v3.13-rc1) and merge that to 
clk-next that would be perfect as it would minimize the amount of changes 
merged by Simon.
