Thank you.

Given that it's too late to push this to v3.11 through the ARM SoC tree 
(please correct me if I'm wrong), what about pushing 1/5 through the PWM tree 
for v3.11 and 2/5 to 5/5 through ARM SoC for v3.12 ? Thierry, would you be 
able to pick patch 1/5 for v3.11 ?

Pin 163 was used for both TPU LEDs and SCIFB RTS in the original board code, 
hence the conflict. That's most probably a mistake. Do you have the kota2 
schematics ? If so, could you please confirm that pin 163 is used for the LED 
only, not for SCIFB RTS ? I'll then send a patch to fix this.

I'll work on that.
