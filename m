Usually you should just be able to enable any boards together,
independent of whether they are using DT or not. It's possible
that shmobile does something different from the other platforms
that I'm not aware of, of course. If you look at e.g.
omap2plus_defconfig or imx_v6_v7_defconfig, they both enable
all the available boards.

Device drivers that don't use DT should get their configuration from
platform_data. The command line can be used to override those, but it's
also normally passed by the boot loader, which also has to configure
e.g. how much memory is present or which uart to use.
