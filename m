This is not the right fix.  The commit you previously pointed out (removal
of CPU hotplug) probably means there's a missing annotation somewhere in
the code.

And yes - the __CPUINIT just before ENTRY(secondary_startup) was removed
rather than being replaced with a .text (in both head.S and head-nommu.S).
Same goes for ENTRY(lookup_processor_type) in head-common.S.  All these
need to be replaced with .text to stop them falling into the head section.
