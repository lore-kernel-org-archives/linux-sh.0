Waiting an entire kernel version to throw some arbitrary dts file updates
in seems a bit absurd, but I'll let you handle it however you like. I
haven't sent out my SH updates to Linus yet, but plan to do so by -rc2
(there isn't really that much to begin with, most of it has gone through
other trees), so in light of this I will throw the sh-sci OF patch in to
my queue directly then.
