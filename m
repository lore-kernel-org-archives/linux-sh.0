Hi Geert,

Thank you for the patch.

Isn't it better, like with C code, to explicitly include headers that provide 
the macros you need, instead of relying on implicit #include's that could 
change later ? OK, in this specific case, it's very unlikely that r8a7779.dtsi 
would stop including <dt-bindings/interrupt-controller/irq.h>, but in the 
general case I believe explicit includes to be good practice.
