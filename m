Hi,

this is an updated series that is still very much work-in-progress.
So far contributions bave been made by Magnus Damm, Iwamatsu-san and myself.

The aims of this series are:

* Adding DT support to INTC
* Allowing relevant ARM shmobile SoCs to use DT to initialise INTC
* Allowing relevant ARM shmobile boards to use DT to initialise INTC
* Allowing the sh73a0 SoC use DT to initialise GIC
* Allowing the sh73a0 SoC use DT to initialise GIC, which in
  turn allows the kzm9g board to use DT to initialise GIC

Oustanding work includes:

* Work has been done on the sh7372 to consolidate the C code,
  minimise #ifdefs and make use of a common compatibility string.
  This work should be reflected in the r8a7740 and sh73a0 SoCs which
  this series already modifies.

* Evaluate why the following, as described by Magnus Damm, doesn't work.

  "I tried using the INTC DT interrupt controller code with external
   interrupt pins on the sh7372 mackerel board with DT, but for some
   reason the following network device refuses to probe due to some
   interrupt issue.
                
       lan9220@14000000 {
               compatible = "smsc,lan9220", "smsc,lan9115";
               reg = <0x14000000 0x2000000>;
               phy-mode = "mii";
               interrupt-parent = <&intca_irq_pins_lo>;
               interrupts = <0x2c0>;
               reg-io-width = <4>;
               smsc,irq-push-pull;
       };

   The above snippet is nicked and adjusted from my earlier prototype patches:
   [PATCH] sh: INTC IRQ domain and DT support prototype
   [PATCH] ARM: mach-shmobile: sh7372 DT IRQ prototype

   I wonder, is there any outstanding INTC work related to IRQ domains?"
