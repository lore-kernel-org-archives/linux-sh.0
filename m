Have you given any thought as to whether the platform_device_wakeup and 
platform_device_idle calls should be restricted to process context?

You should consider using a special workqueue for this stuff instead of 
relying on the default workqueue.  It can help avoid deadlocks, and it 
has the advantage that you can define the workqueue to be freezable.  
(Generally speaking, you don't want platform-level wakeup and idle 
calls to start running spontaneously in the middle of a system sleep 
transition.)
