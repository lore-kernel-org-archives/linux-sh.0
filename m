Since this patch series configures the LCDC, and CEU to use the IPMMU,
checking the memory addresses that those blocks are using are properly
registered in the IPMMU, and verifying that they actually function seems
like the best way to test this driver. I'll take a look at doing that.

That said, there currently isn't any way to use this with UIO devices,
since enabling the IPMMU with break direct accesses to physical memory
from all of the IP blocks on the ICB (LCDC, CEU, VPU, VEU, etc.)
For these devices, memory allocated with the dma-mapping API *must* be
used with IPMMU enabled.  The current uio_pdrv_genirq driver isn't set
up to deal with this right now.
