Hello,

This is the fourth and hopefully final version of the CCF clock drivers for
the Renesas R-Car R8A7790 (H2) and R8A7791 (M2) SoCs. I plan to send a pull
request on Wednesday to Mike Turquette and have thus rebased the patches on
top of v3.13-rc1 and removed the arch/ specific changes.

The patches are pretty self-explanatory and described in their respective
commit message. The R8A7790 and R8A7791 datasheets are unfortunately not
publicly available.

Changes compared to v3:

- Clarified the usage of the reg and clocks DT properties for the MSTP driver
- Rebased on top of v3.13-rc1
- Dropped the arch/ specific changes

Changes compared to v2:

- Fixed I2C MSTP clocks parents (hp -> p)
- Added Z and Z2 clocks
- Added r8a7791 clocks to DT

Changes compared to v1:

- The core CPG clocks driver now supports the r8a7791 SoC in addition to the
r8a7790. They are collectively refered to as 'R-Car Gen2'. The driver has thus
been renamed to clk-rcar-gen2.c. The DT bindings have been updated accordingly.
- Several MSTP clocks have been added to the r8a7790-clock.h header and a new
header has been added for the r8a7791
- The r8a7790 dtsi patches that add and reference clocks have been added to
this series.
