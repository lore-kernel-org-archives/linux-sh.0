Because the drivers using this clock don't know that it's a fixed clock.

For example, a uart needs to know the rate of its clock source, so that it can 
set its internal divisors to get a valid baud rate. The uart driver will query  
the input rate using clk_get_rate(). The driver still needs to call 
clk_enable/clk_prepare/etc, because on some systems it may have a switchable 
clock.

Cheers,


Jeremy
