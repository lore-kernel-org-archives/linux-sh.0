I agree it's not nice to have to do this, but this is largely because
of shmobile doing things differently from all other ARM platforms, on
which the respective patches tend to clean up things and reduce the
number of type casts.

The only alternative I can see is for shmobile to introduce its own
mach/io.h file with the relaxed type checking, but that would only
defer the problem until the point where you want shmobile to be part
of the common multiplatform kernel binary.
