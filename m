Changes since V1: kept sorting by bit number

Note: Adding clocks whilst keeping the current sorting is very likely to
break a previously working clock IMO. Imagine adding PCIEC clock inbetween IIC0
and IIC1 here. Adding chronologically and grouped by similar function blocks is
easier to track IMO. An example addition could then look like:

 	R8A7791_CLK_TPU0
 	R8A7791_CLK_SDHI2 R8A7791_CLK_SDHI1 R8A7791_CLK_SDHI0
 	R8A7791_CLK_MMCIF0
 	R8A7791_CLK_CMT1
	R8A7791_CLK_IIC0 R8A7791_CLK_IIC1
+	R8A7791_CLK_PCIEC
