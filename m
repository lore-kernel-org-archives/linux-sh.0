These two WARN_ON()s are triggered a lot when using a legacy clock domain,
and CONFIG_PM=n. Indeed, without Runtime PM, the idea is that the module clocks
get enabled unconditionally, which violates the assumptions above.

Cfr. the CONFIG_PM=n version of pm_clk_notify() in
drivers/base/power/clock_ops.c, which calls enable_clock():

    /**
     * enable_clock - Enable a device clock.
     * @dev: Device whose clock is to be enabled.
     * @con_id: Connection ID of the clock.
     */
    static void enable_clock(struct device *dev, const char *con_id)
    {
            struct clk *clk;

            clk = clk_get(dev, con_id);
            if (!IS_ERR(clk)) {
                    clk_prepare_enable(clk);
                    clk_put(clk);
                    dev_info(dev, "Runtime PM disabled, clock forced on.\n");
            }
    }

I think this affects shmobile, keystone, davinci, omap1, and legacy sh.

Sorry for not noticing before, we usually build with CONFIG_PM=y.
One more reason for making CONFIG_PM=y mandatory on SoCs with clock domains?
