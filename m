The problem with this is that on a lot of dma engines you have one channel
per slave (in particular with virt-dma.c), so the slave-id has to be
part of the filter data. Since the slave driver cannot know what kind
of DMA engine it is connected to, it has to assume that the slave-id
is inherent to the channel an cannot change.
Also, the DT binding is built around the idea that you identify the
channel or request line with the specifier in whichever form the
dma engine requires, and there is no general way for the slave driver
to find out a slave id. Setting it with dma_slave_config is inherently
nonportable, and we should stop doing that.
