Looks good to me, except for the one detail I've commented
on in the third patch.

I do wonder if the sh and mips implementations are robust enough however
(independent of your work): It seems that an ioport number is treated
differently in pci_iomap than it is using ioport_map and inb/outb,
the assumption being that the port number is a local index per PCI domain.
This would mean that any port access other than pci_iomap would only
work on the primary PCI domain. There are two IMHO better solutions that
I've seen on other architectures:

1. create a larger (e.g. 1MB) io port mapping range in virtual memory
that is split into 64kb per domain, and use the domain number to
find the per domain range when setting the resources. Port numbers will
be larger than 65535 this way, but PCI will ignore the upper address
bits for any access so it works fine.

2. split the 64kb io port range into subsections per domain (on page
granularity, e.g. 2 domains with 32kb or at most 16 domains with 4kb)
and map them virtually contiguous, then reassign all io port resources
so that only the correct region for each domain is used.
