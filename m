The dependency is correct, but the status has changed. Mike has merged the 
patches in his tree in the clk-next-shmobile branch 
(https://git.linaro.org/people/mike.turquette/linux.git/shortlog/refs/heads/clk-next-shmobile).

You can drop this dependency as the koelsch reference boards lack SDHI support 
and the lager reference board has the SDHI devices disabled.

You can drop this dependency as the lager and koelsch reference boards lack 
SPI support.

Correct, but you can drop this dependency as the lager and koelsch reference 
boards lack USB support.

That's the only missing one. Do you plan to handle this with Daniel ?
