    I don't think so. As I said the EHCI driver happily works without touching 
this bit.

    I believe it's a wrong impression (which probably my and Valentine's PHY 
drivers have created). The PHY actually belongs to USBHS only; UGCTRL2 
register is some kind of ad-hockery in this PHY.

    Generic PHY core already maintains such counters for phy_{init|exit}() and 
phy_power_{on|off}() calls.

    I handle this bit but only for USBHS. What is actually necessary for all 
USB controllers is enabling the USBHS clocks in order for UGCTRL2 to work.

    I cannnot represent USBHS in the device tree yet. I think I can represent 
xHCI there but I was told it needs the firmware in order to work -- which we 
don't have, so I'm not sure about xHCI testing.
