I'm worried that without a current user these properties aren't going to
see any testing...

... which means that they could be wrong, and will get in the way of
stability rather than aiding it.

I'm also concerned that the carving up of clock inputs, power domains,
and other physical details is implementation-specific. I imagine that
pretty much every user that will care about this is using GIC-400, so
could we make this specific to GIC-400?

I imagine that it's possible for the distributor and CPU interfaces to
be in separate power domains in some implementaitons.

Which components of the GIC does the apply to? The whole thing? Just the
GICD?

Depending on implementation, a GIC could require multiple clocks, and
their names would be implementation-specific (that said, GIC-400 has a
single "CLK" input).

Assuming that you're using GIC-400, could we use clock-names to make
that explicit?

Thanks,
Mark.
