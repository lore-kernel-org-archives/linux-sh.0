    OTOH, since Ether support currently isn't working anyway, it doesn't 
make sense
to push it as a consolidated patch with sh_eth.c change, and fix up the 
names up separately
thru the renesas.git anyway. So I'll probably just respin these two 
patches later, when
I'm done with getting rid of #ifdef's in the driver and it's merged by 
Dave...

WBR, Sergei
