I believe that this patch depends on
"irqchip: renesas-intc-irqpin: DT binding for sense bitfield width"
which Arnd has requested some modifications to.

"I think you should add documentation here about how the two interrupt
cells are to be interpreted, to allow people to fill the values from a data
sheet or board schematic."

Please post a fresh series that:

1. Includes a fresh version of "irqchip: renesas-intc-irqpin: DT binding
   for sense bitfield width" with Arnd's concerns addressed.

2. Includes this patch with Magnus's Ack.

Please be sure to CC Arnd on the new series.
