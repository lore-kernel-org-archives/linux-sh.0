I was thinking about earlycon support...

Good to know there are still some parts missing.

Hence we're gonna need debug_ll anyway?
So far I only needed it for real early issues.

OK, will move it up.

Yep. Never copy swenglish comments.

On r8a7779 map_io() is not empty, but it didn't cover the SCIF registers,
