I recall changing my i2c bus driver i2c-sh_mobile.c from module_init()
to subsys_initcall() a few years ago (see
ccb3bc16b4891a82649d4bccbeefe60b1d9a62e2) - this because regular
drivers tend to use module_init() and following the link order is not
enough. I think the patch for tca6416 is more or less the same issue
but on subsys_initcall() level instead.

I'm not sure if this is i2c specific though - in general you probably
need to register the parent bus driver first.

I've seen some SH-Mobile designs with PMICs, and they all use a
dedicated i2c bus.

The dependency tracking is a bit primitive with only initcalls. I
wouldn't mind something like this:

-static int __init tca6416_keypad_init(void)
-{
-	return i2c_add_driver(&tca6416_keypad_driver);
-}
-
-subsys_initcall(tca6416_keypad_init);
-
-static void __exit tca6416_keypad_exit(void)
-{
-	i2c_del_driver(&tca6416_keypad_driver);
-}
-module_exit(tca6416_keypad_exit);
+i2c_driver_module(&tca6416_keypad_driver);

Cheers,
