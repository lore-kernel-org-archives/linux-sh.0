Hi Arnd,

I understand from Olof that you are handling pull-requests at this time.
I would like you to consider this one in light of the extra
information that I have provided below.

This should have been :

         * "Third Round of Renesas ARM Based SoC Clock Updates for v3.17",
	   tagged as renesas-clock3-for-v3.17.

	   I somehow forgot to tag that branch and send a pull-request.
	   I have done so now.

Thanks. I believe that the cause of this problem is the missing
renesas-clocks3-for-v3.17 pull-request that I noted above.

As discussed off-list, I think that with that taken into account this
pull-request should match its description.
