Right, Chris also mentioned the of_get_named_gpio_flags() method that
drivers would need to use to get the flags, although currently
most of them don't.

Makes sense. It seems that the MMC_CAP2_RO_ACTIVE_HIGH flag is only
evaluated by the generic mmc_gpio_get_ro() helper function you wrote
and that is currently used in only one host driver, while the
SDHCI_QUIRK_INVERTED_WRITE_PROTECT obviously is only used in SDHCI.
It certainly makes sense to unify those flags.

Yes. It was worse before I introduced the common mmc binding, when
each driver had its own method. I left the sdhci specific one there
because there are (old) preexising users of that on powerpc that
would suffer from an incompatible change to the binding, but I
changed some of those that I knew had few existing users.

Fine with me, too. It's not a case I'm worried about for the practical
applications. My thought was that it would be just as easy and more logical
to combine the two using XOR as it is using OR logic wherever they get
interpreted, but if it's easier to use OR, then I don't object.
