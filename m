Subject: [PATCH] mmc: mmcif: don't clear masked interrupts

Masking events on MMCIF means, an occurrence of the masked event won't raise
an interrupt, but the event bit will still be set in the interrupt status
register. If simultaneously a different event occurs, that was enabled, both
flags will be set. However, only the unmasked event bit should be cleared in
the status register in such a case. Clearing also the masked bit can lead to
lost interrupts, which indeed can be observed on the armadillo800eva r8a7740
board with an eMMC chip. The problem has been introduced by the recent "mmc:
sh_mmcif: simplify IRQ processing" patch. Fix the problem by only clearing
enabled interrupts.

Chris, please, push this fix to 3.10, thanks.
