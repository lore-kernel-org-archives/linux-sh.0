For the reasons explained by Geert, this is to me also a "workaround".

I would replace pm_runtime_put() and pm_runtime_disable() with a call
to pm_runtime_force_suspend().

In that way, you will make sure you device get runtime suspended
(clock domain will gate the clock). Additionally, the runtime PM
status will properly reflect the status of the device.

I totally agree on your analyse.

The problem is that the runtime PM status of the device isn't
correctly updated at ->remove(). The effect is that the the
pm_runtime_get_sync() in ->probe() at re-bind will *not* trigger the
->runtime_resume() callbacks to be invoked, as the runtime PM core
believes the device is already runtime resumed.

Kind regards
Uffe
