Putting it back is not hard. And the infrastructure is not currently
used for these purposes so renaming it is appropriate. I can leave it in
place if you like, i.e. make a new op for cpu_can_disable and repoint
mcpm's mcpm_cpu_disable() at it. Then when mcpm gets migrate support it
can actually implement a cpu_disable op.

That's fine I can split it out.
