You could have been lucky?

On Koelsch, I only had failures after Real Cold Boot, i.e. on boot up in the
morning. And not always, so there could be a timing issue involved.

Furthermore, I haven't seen any SPI timeouts after I disabled MD21 (holding
wood, and rabbit legs ;-). So the SMP memory (in)coherency I saw there
could have been caused by a wobbly SMP setup.
