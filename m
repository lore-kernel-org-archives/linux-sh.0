On shmobile SoCs supporting power domains, the power domain is
overridden later by calling rmobile_add_devices_to_domains() and friends.

My patch doesn't change that: the code behaved the same in the
non-multi-platform case before: dev->pm_domain as set from
drivers/sh/pm_runtime.c was overridden later.

I'll have a deeper look into the power domain code later anyway.

Thanks!

Gr{oetje,eeting}s,
