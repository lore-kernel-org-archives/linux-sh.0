Thanks for your recommendation about common clocks, but I believe this
patch really has nothing todo with clocks. It's about SCIF UART
support. The state for SCIF DT support is however similar to common
clocks, so we don't have any DT bindings yet.

Fortunately, SCIF DT support is also planned for the next 6 months, so
over time we can kill off these platform device bits.

Cheers,
