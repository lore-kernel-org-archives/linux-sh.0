Subject: [PATCH/RFC] ARM: shmobile: r8a7794: Add Audio DMAC, PWM and Thermal clocks to device tree

This is based on the MSTP5 clocks in the r8a7791 device tree.
The main difference being that the r8a7794 does not have an Audio DMAC1
clock.

Signed-off-by: Simon Horman <horms+renesas@verge.net.au>

Based on the renesas-devel-20141217-v3.18 tag of my renesas tree.

N.B: The R-Car Gen2 v1.8.0 BSP uses zs_clk whereas this patch uses hp_clk
     as the parent clock for the Audio DMAC clock.

     In that regard this patch follows the pattern used in mainline for the
     r8a7790 and r8a7791 SoCs.

     The BSP's parent clock is consistent for the r8a7790, r8a7791, r8a7793
     and r8a7794 SoCs.

     Support for the r8a7793 SoC is not present in mainline.
