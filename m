Speaking on behalf of OMAP PM developers, and as maintainer of the
current OMAP PM infrastructure, this is a major step towards a generic
runtime PM that we would use on OMAP as well.

In the PM branch of the linux-omap tree, we currently have an ad-hoc
but working infrastructure for all of this, including device-specific
save/restore hooks for supporting some or all of the on-chip
powerdomains to go off during idle.

However, our current approach hides most of the details behind the
clock framework, custom save/restore hooks and in some cases custom
platform hooks passed using platform_data.

I like this proposed approach much better as it generalizes the
approach and allows us to share the infrastructure across arches
as well as decouple device idleness from clock management.
