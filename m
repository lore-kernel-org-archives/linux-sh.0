Thanks for writing a fix, Russell. I cherry picked the following
commit from linux-arm:

cd717a2 ARM: Add .text annotations where required after __CPUINIT removal

Applying it on top of kernel.org renesas git tag
renesas-devel-20130801v2 (v3.11-rc3 + v3.12 material) solves the
problem for me. I just tested this on KZM9G hardware without and with
the patch, so I can confirm that CPU Hotplug is now working again.

Tested-by: Magnus Damm <damm@opensource.se>

Cheers,
