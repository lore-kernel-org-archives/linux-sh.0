I'd rather see this possibility enabled than have separate multiplatform
and non-multiplatform Kconfig entries for each machine that may
want XIP_KERNEL. The same thing applies to no-MMU support: we now
have platforms (i.MX for now, other likely to follow) that are already
multiplatform and that are gaining support for no-MMU implementations.

For those too, we need to set the physical address, which means
we can not run on othe rmachines that may be configured at the
same time.

For a XIP kernel, I'd normally expect the user to turn off all machines
other than the one that the kernel is meant to run on, except for build
testing.

I think a number of people have expressed that they'd rather get rid of the
DEBUG_LL list in the long run, now that we have earlycon working. If we
can treat XIP_KERNEL as a special case that would only be used for special
embedded systems, I don't think we need a preconfigured list of defaults,
but rather hide XIP_KERNEL under CONFIG_EXPERT and expect the few users
that need it to know the address or start with a working defconfig file
that has it configured.
