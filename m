If it's only about arch/arm/boot/compressed, you can just move the
header files to the same directory, as nothing else includes them.

I've played with a full multiplatform conversion of a few platforms
including shmobile in the past, and all I needed for the legacy pinctrl
drivers was to duplicate the irq_pin() definition, which is probably
a reasonable hack for code that we know is going away anyway, just
add a comment for both definitions explaining that they have to be
kept in sync. This one is less obvious than the boot header.

One general comment: please use 'git format-patch -M' or set the
'diff.renames' git option for sending patches for reviews that
rename files. No need to send this patch set again.
