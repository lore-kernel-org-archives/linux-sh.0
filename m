You're right.

sh_dmae_ctl_stop() stops the DMA controller.  But this is the "master stop".
At this time, the individual channels should have been stopped by dmae_halt().

So you prefer my V1 patch instead, which unconditionally runtime-resumed
the device, so sh_dmae_ctl_stop() can be called?
http://www.spinics.net/lists/dmaengine/msg02954.html

Alternatively...

Both sh_dmae_resume() and sh_dmae_runtime_resume() call sh_dmae_rst(),
which re-initializes the DMAOR register.
To make it symmetric, we can move the call to sh_dmae_ctl_stop() to
sh_dmae_suspend() and sh_dmae_runtime_suspend() instead?
