IMO, that needs to depend on the bus type.  If the bus type has a way
to manage PM for devices without drivers, it should be allowed to do so.

Of course, the platform bus type is somewhat special in that respect,
but it looks like we simply need some sort of a convention in there too
(the expectations should be the same for everybody).
