Subject: [PATCH v7 0/9] Consolidate cpuidle functionality

This patch series moves various functionality duplicated in platform 
cpuidle drivers to the core cpuidle driver. Also, the platform irq
disabling was removed as it appears that all calls into 
cpuidle_call_idle will have already called local_irq_disable().

Rafael,

Could you review this patchset and merge patch 1/9 once its ready?  It
seems pretty close to being acceptable.  The get_maintainer script shows
Len Brown as the cpuidle maintainer but I've been unable to get a response
from him so far.  If you are not the right person, could you suggest
who I can make this request to?  Thanks.

Note to platform maintainers:

Platform patches (2/9 to 9/9) in this patchset are not required to work
with patch 1/9 but please review and push these platform changes as possible
to allow this consolidation to occur.

Based on 3.3-rc5 plus recent exynos cpuidle patch (affects exynos cpuidle only):
http://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-samsung-soc/msg09467.html

v6 submission tested successfully on Exynos (thanks Amit Kacchap) and OMAP3 
(thanks Jean Pihet) platforms.

v6 submission can be found here:
http://www.spinics.net/lists/arm-kernel/msg162018.html
Changes since v6:
* Made some  struct whitespace alignment changes.
* Fixed a coding style violation (thanks Jean Pihet)
* Fixed a bug in davinci cpuidle (thanks Jean Pihet)
* Corrected the common ARM cpuidle WFI state description to be ARM platform
  agnostic (thanks Kevin Hilman)
* Fixed the problem causing x86 and PPC builds to fail (thanks Deepthi)
* Re-added a line of code that was mistakenly removed (thanks Deepthi)
