    I know. Too bad the driver's original author managed to misunderstand that...

     I don't understand the case of the PCI devices, honestly. Shouldn't the 
"device_type" prop reflect the device's functionality rather than the bus 
where it's located?

    It is already in the common location, AFAIK; what's lacking there is the 
code that parses "dma-ranges" as well but that should be pretty easy to add...
