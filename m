It'd be nice to keep the dts changes in your DT branch, so there's less risk
for add/remove conflicts. I don't think there will be any this release so it's
not a big deal, but keep it in mind in the future.

Also, as already mentioned, some of this could have gone in one larger joined
branch (and based on the cleanups to avoid conflicts).
