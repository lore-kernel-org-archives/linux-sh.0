Sorry, terminology confusion on my side. Most other platforms sorted
this out when they moved to sparse irq, removing most hardcoded interrupt
numbers at the same time and handling it through DT. But since shmobile
still has a ways to go on DT conversion things are a bit different.

Either way, once things have been converted fully to DT, most of these
static numberings can/should be possible to remove.
