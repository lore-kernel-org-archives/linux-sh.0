Ok, it seems that I was slightly mistaken. But we are working towards
multi-platform support for v3.20, right?

Could you take a moment to look at what is currently queued up in
the sh73a0-multiplatform-for-v3.20 branch, which is based on this
pull-request and see if you think any re-arrangement of that branch
is in order.

To be clear, I'm not suggesting changing this pull-request which has
already been accepted.
