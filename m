Yes, I believe something more advanced is needed for 4-bit mode. But I
don't really have any proof. I just know that I spent quite some time
trying to get it to work and ended up staying in polling mode because
enabling real IRQs seemed to require too much time. This was before
some interrupt ack fixes so things may have improved since then. I
also remember both testing on b43 hardware and AR6002.

There are a couple of things against us at this point:

a) b43 hardware may not be enough to test this

are you really sure 4-bit mode is enabled? =3D)
is the b43 driver doing multi-block data transfers? i believe IRQs
work differently for multi-block data transfers and single-block.

b) we don't have any public data sheet for the SDHI hardware block

how good is that?

c) the simplified SDIO spec is not exactly full of details:

8.1.3
Interrupt Period Definition
This section is not included in the Simplified Specification.
8.1.4
Interrupt Period at the Data Block Gap in 4-bit SD Mode (Optional)
This section is not included in the Simplified Specification.
8.1.5
Inhibited Interrupts (Removed Section)
This section is not included in the Simplified Specification.
8.1.6
End of Interrupt Cycles
This section is not included in the Simplified Specification.

Yeah, that seems to be the case. I guess it's a non-issue then. =3D)

I'll try to find my AR6002 card, maybe that will shed some light...

Thanks,
