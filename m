Hi Olof, Hi Kevin, Hi Arnd,

Please consider these Renesas ARM based SoC clock fixes for v3.17.

This pull request is based on third round of Renesas ARM based SoC
lock updates for v3.17, tagged as renesas-clock3-for-v3.17,
which you have previously pulled.

I would like the first to patches considered for -stable.

  ARM: shmobile: r8a7791: add missing 0x0100 for SDCKCR (2014-08-22 09:59:54 +0900)

----------------------------------------------------------------
Renesas ARM Based SoC Clock Fixes For v3.17

* ARM: shmobile: r8a7791: add missing 0x0100 for SDCKCR

  This resolves a problem introduced by 4bfb358b1d6cdeff
  ("ARM: shmobile: Add r8a7791 legacy SDHI clocks")
  which was included in v3.15.

  This fix does not have any run-time affect at this time.

* ARM: shmobile: r8a7790: add missing 0x0100 for SDCKCR

  This resolves a problem introduced by 9f13ee6f83c52065
  ("ARM: shmobile: r8a7790: add div4 clocks")
  which was included in v3.11.

  This fix does not have any run-time affect at this time.

* ARM: shmobile: sh73a0: Remove spurious 0x from SCIFB clock name

  This resolves a problem introduced by a0f7e7496d56ac2d
  ("ARM: shmobile: sh73a0: add CMT1 clock support for DT")
  which was included in v3.17-rc1.

  This fix does not have any run-time affect at this time as the clock in
  question is used by a SCIF device that is not enabled by default.
