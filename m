They are in microseconds.

You seem to be confusing things.  The exact meaning of this number is:
"I may want to use the device 100 us from now (but not earlier), so please
make it possible to do that".  [It roughly means "don't put the device into
a low-power state that takes more than 100 us to resume from", but it's a bit
more complicated than that.]  It doesn't mean "don't suspend the device for
the next 100 us".

I'm not sure how that's possible, at least until your platform starts
to use device PM QoS.

Which is kind of independent.
