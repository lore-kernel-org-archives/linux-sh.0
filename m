Several platform support codes combine pm_generic_runtime_suspend() and
pm_clk_suspend(), resp. pm_clk_resume() and pm_generic_runtime_resume() in
their .runtime_suspend resp. .runtime_resume callbacks.

Create helpers to consolidate.

  - [1/6] PM / clock_ops: Add helpers combining generic runtime and generic
	  clock PM
  - [2/6] ARM: davinci: Use generic runtime and clock helpers
  - [3/6] ARM: keystone: Use generic runtime and clock helpers
  - [4/6] ARM: omap: Use generic runtime and clock helpers
  - [5/6] drivers: sh: Use generic runtime and clock helpers
  - [6/6] of/clk: Use generic runtime and clock helpers

Patches 5 and 6 have dependencies (listed in the individual patches),
but they can be postponed and handled later.

Thanks!

when I'm talking to journalists I just say "programmer" or something like that.
