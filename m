Hi Paul and serial forks,

Here are sh-sci serial driver fixes that have been cooking for months
privately on my end:
* console PM rework with the help of serial-core's uart_change_pm()
* provide missing piece in SCIFB support (from Yoshii-san)
* address console write function vs. SMP lockup issue

and so on.  Comments and suggestions are welcome.

Build tested with vanilla v3.6, but not boot- nor PM-tested with
newer kernels after v3.4.  Anyone with can-sleep shmobile systems,
please give it try.

Thanks in advance,
