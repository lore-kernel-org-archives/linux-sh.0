I've noticed you have dropped the following patches from your devel branch:

clk: shmobile: div6: Avoid changing divisor in .disable()
clk: shmobile: Add r8a7793 support
clk: shmobile: r8a7793: document CPG clock support
clk: shmobile: r8a73a4 common clock framework implementation
clk: shmobile: Add r8a73a4 SoC to MSTP bindings
clk: shmobile: Add R-Car Gen2 RCAN clock support
clk: shmobile: Add R-Car Gen2 ADSP clock support

I don't see those patches queued in Mike Turquette's CCF tree.

How should they be handled, and do they need to be delayed to v3.21 ?
