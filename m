Right, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't fix that while we still can :-) For 
the r8a73a4 we're probably stuck (I won't reiterate here my view of 
considering DT bindings as stable when it's clear they haven't gone through 
proper review), but before we add support for new SoCs I'd like to see to 
problems being fixed.
