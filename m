What we might need to think about is the evolutional pace of the ARM
kernel - compared to a few years back we have increased the change
rate by orders of a magnitude (at least that is my feeling...)

There may be some point where we actually need to tell people to
hold changes back because they are just pushing too large volumes
through one merge window, resulting in a corresponding amount of
fixes.

This merge window both Samsung Exynos and SH mobile seem to
have been a little bit trigger-happy :-/

Yours,
