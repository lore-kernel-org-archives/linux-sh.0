I agree the first two are non-critical.

The third, "Renesas ARM Based SoC Fixes for v3.18" may fix a regression
introduced in v3.16. While the original problem with the i2c timings was
indeed present in v2.6.37, the i2c bys most probably "just worked" (albeit with
wrong timings), until the i2c-sh_mobile driver got more picky in commit
7663ebefca8079ef ("i2c: sh_mobile: check timing parameters for valid range").

when I'm talking to journalists I just say "programmer" or something like that.
