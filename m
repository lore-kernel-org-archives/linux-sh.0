This is now commit 2b18a0eb107677d4 ("staging: board: Set PM domain before
probe").

I seem to have missed this introduces the following BUG on r8a7740/armadillo:

    BUG: spinlock lockup suspected on CPU#0, swapper/1

The boot just continues and the display still works, and I guess that's why I
didn't notice before; sorry for that.

__pm_genpd_add_device() is now called before platform_device_register(),
at which time "dev->power.lock" hasn't been initialized yet, as
device_initialize() is only called from platform_device_register().

I can kill the warning by #including "../../base/power/power.h" and calling
pm_runtime_early_init(&pdev->dev) before pm_genpd_add_device(), but that's
a bit hacky.

When the PM domain is added in some other way (e.g. based on the
"power-domains" property in DT), this is done through
dev_pm_domain_attach() -> genpd_dev_pm_attach() ->
pm_genpd_add_device(), which is called from platform_drv_probe(), i.e.
after the device was registered, but before a driver is bound.

Thoughts?

Thanks, and sorry again for not noticing before.

Gr{oetje,eeting}s,
