The approach that shmobile is taking is to either initialise a device
entirely using C (non-DT) or entirely using DT. And moreover to either
initialise a board using C or DT (though in the latter case some devices
still end up being initialised in C to provide a minimally working system).

At this time for more recent boards we typically provide both a C and DT
versions to initialise a board. The C version typically is able to
initialise a fuller set of hardware while the DT version catches up.

In this case the device is being initialised in C. And this code is
intended ti be used when a board and thus its SoC is initialised using C.

Once the SH ethernet driver and all its pre-requisite drivers and
infrastructure can be initialised using DT then that will be used when
initialising the board using DT.
