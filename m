The SDHI driver already supports making use of up to three interrupt
sources.

This series breaks up the existing interrupt handler into three handlers,
one for sdcard access, one for card detect and one for SDIO interrupts.
A cover-all handler, which makes use of these new broken-out handlers
is provided for for the case where there is a multiplexed interrupt source.

This series also wires up the new IRQ handlers for the mackerel and ag4evm.

This series contains the following patches:

[PATCH v8 1/4] mmc: tmio: Cache interrupt masks
[PATCH v8 2/4] mmc: tmio: Provide separate interrupt handlers
[PATCH v8 3/4] mmc: sdhi: Allow name IRQs to use specific handlers
[PATCH v8 4/4] ARM: shmobile: ag5evm, ap4: Named SDHI IRQ sources
