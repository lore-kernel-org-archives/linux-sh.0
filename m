I agree this looks a bit lonely by itself, and I'm not entirely
opposed to removing it. However, I do seek consistency between
the renesas ARM and ARM64 SoCs where possible.

Further work[1] on this file outside of this series adds
"rw root=/dev/nfs ip=dhcp" to bootargs, the result being consistent
with Renesas ARM32 SoCs.

I think that we have had this discussion before in relation to
a different board for a different Renesas SoC but I could be mistaken.

The r8a7795 uses the sh-sci serial driver for which the default rate is
115200. It is hard for me to conceive of a situation where that would
change without due consideration being given to the implications for DT
files.

Not specifying the baud here is consistent with what we have
been doing for ARM32 Renesas SoCs for some time.
