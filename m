Getting it into the patch system would be a big help, but since I've
closed my tree down for this merge window already, it's missed the
boat.  (With Linus' new "random" behaviour wrt when things happen, I'm
not planning on a second ARM kernel pull request - and the first was
sent last night.)

This is probably the patch I was referring to in my notice of closure
when I said:

Especially as it's 4000 messages back in this mailbox!
