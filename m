I don't follow 100% what you're telling me, but I don't think this would help:
the HDMI interrupt is used for HDMI hotplug detection, so it should stay
enabled even when the HDMI device is runtime suspended.
Only when the system is suspended, and the PM domain will be powered
down, the interrupt can be disabled.

After powering up the PM domain, but before the interrupt is enabled,
the registers must be restored.

pm_genpd_suspend() and pm_genpd_suspend_late() call the
pm_generic_*() version if no genpd->suspend_power_off callback is
set up.

pm_genpd_suspend_noirq() does some really different things (i.e.
powering down the PM domain), so IMHO this isn't trivial to change.
