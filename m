If I remember correctly, when I first ran into an issue was my
initramfs got cut off because it spanned the 1MB boundary after
_etext.

Also, your init code resides after _etext, so that get cut off
too.

If the MMU is set up to cut everything off after _etext early on, then
anything in the init section gets blown away, and there are lots
of init functions in the kernel that get run at various times during
boot.

During boot, the kernel attempts to execute code that is not mapped
anywhere, and hence crashes.
