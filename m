Namely arm, powerpc, and sh.

This is not actually true for arm and sh, afaics. They do not even
need tasklist or rcu lock for for_each_process().

__cpu_disable() is called by __stop_machine(), we know that nobody
can preempt us and other CPUs can do nothing.

Yes,

And only powerpc needs rcu_read_lock() and task_lock().

OTOH, I do not understand why powepc does this on CPU_DEAD...
And probably CPU_UP_CANCELED doesn't need to clear mm_cpumask().

That said, personally I think these patches are fine, the common
helper makes sense.
