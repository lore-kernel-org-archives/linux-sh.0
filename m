Presently my LANDISK is in storage along with lots of other stuff due
to fire, but as far as I know it was not damaged. However I never got
directions for how to install a new kernel and point the bootloader at
it. It'll probably be another couple months before I get to moving
back in and unpacking everything from storage, but if you or anyone
else can get me the info between now and then on how to install new
kernel rather than just dd'ing a whole disk image, I'll follow up as
soon as I can.
