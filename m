Hi Phil,

I'm happy that you found use for my patch, but I can't help wondering if it is
not a better idea to convert your drivers to the whole new API in my series.
Do you have any thoughts on that?

One other thing to note: Rob Herring is not very happy with the mix of OF
parsing and domain number allocation going in together, so I might remove the
OF parsing entirely for now. Would that cause you any problems (other than
the fact that if of_pci_get_domain_nr() doesn't do anything OF related I might
rename it to pci_get_domain_nr()). You don't seem to have any alias defined
for pci-domain in the DT, so I'll guess not.

Best regards,
Liviu
