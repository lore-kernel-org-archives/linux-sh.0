Thanks for the clarification, I understand.

I wonder if this problem can be resolved using init priorities?

In general I believe the idea is that early clocks can and should
be avoided because they should not be necessary. If they are necessary
in some cases then I assume we will use them.

Magnus, can you clarify this?
