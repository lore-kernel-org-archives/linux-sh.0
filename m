    My main issue is that I don't understand why checking the write protect 
bit is always prohibited for the R-Car SoCs (by setting 
TMIO_MMC_WRPROTECT_DISABLE), i.e. it can only be read via GPIO (though that 
GPIO is just an alias of the WP signal).

    We haven't reached the agreement about the need for update yet.
