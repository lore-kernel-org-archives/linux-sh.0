There is another use that I have looked at, as well: for testing
purposes, it would be extremely good to be able to dirty and/or flush an
arbitrary physical cache line for testing purposes.

This is very very similar to /dev/mem usage -- access to an arbitrary
chunk of memory -- and a fully enabled /dev/mem can of course support
this use (just mmap the page with the relevant cache line).  However, it
could also be a separate device which could have looser permissions than
/dev/mem; or a set of ioctls on /dev/mem with a separate kill switch,
because no data would ever be have modified or returned to user space.

Either way, though, we found that it would share a lot of code with the
/dev/mem implementation, and as such fixing up the underlying machinery
is the sanest way to upstream this.
