Start converting the mach-shmobile subarchitecture from <mach/something.h>
to "something.h". This series covers shared code base and SoC code,
however actual header files are not moved yet. Upcoming series that
depend on this one will have to convert board code as well. When SoCs
code and board code have been converted then actual header files can
be moved and temporary include path workarounds can be removed.
