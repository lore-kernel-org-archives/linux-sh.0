Hi Geert,

Thanks for your patch! Quick comment from my side below:

I've seen this issue on several SoCs actually, and as you describe the
main issue seems to be that there are clock topologies that present
for devices used during boot (like serial) but this clock topology is
not yet managed by software. This does not trigger on all SoCs though.

It is my opinion that it has very little todo with the other devices
that happen to be using the same parent clock. The legacy clock
framework solved this by not allowing clocks to be disabled until all
devices were registered.
