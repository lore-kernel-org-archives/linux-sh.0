The downside is that it's only really applicable if all the subarch
targets which have OProfile support have equivalent perf support. I know
this is the case for SH and ARM, but I'm not sure about other
architectures.

I tried to test them but they don't compile:

arch/arm/oprofile/common.c: In function 'oprofile_arch_exit':
arch/arm/oprofile/common.c:234: error: 'perf_events' undeclared (first use in this function)
arch/arm/oprofile/common.c:234: error: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
arch/arm/oprofile/common.c:234: error: for each function it appears in.)
arch/arm/oprofile/common.c:237: error: 'perf_num_counters' undeclared (first use in this function)
arch/arm/oprofile/common.c:246: error: 'counter_config' undeclared (first use in this function)

This is because the oprofile_arch_exit implementation for ARM frees
data structures that were previously allocated in oprofile_arch_init.
Since this is now done in op_perf_create_files, I'm not sure where the
freeing should be done. OProfile can be compiled as a module, so this
does need to be implemented somewhere (plus, if oprofile_arch_init fails
oprofile_arch_exit is called immediately). Perhaps an op_perf_exit()
function could be called from the arch code?

Looking at the existing ARM implementation, it's not entirely safe in
the case that oprofile_arch_init fails and needs something like:

I can submit this as a separate patch or you can fold it into your changes
to avoid any conflicts.

Cheers,
