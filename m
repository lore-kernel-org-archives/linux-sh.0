Hi Olof, Hi Arnd,

please consider this second round of Renesas ARM-based SoC DT updates for
v3.12.

This pull-request is based on renesas-soc-for-v3.12 which I have
previously sent a pull request-for. That is in turn based on
renesas-dt-for-v3.12. So there is a semi-circular dependency,
but it is not at all clear to me how this could be nicely avoided.

This pull-request has minor conflicts.

* There is a conflict with renesas-cleanup2-for-v3.12,
  which I have previously sent a pull-request for,
  in arch/arm/mach-shmobile/Makefile.boot.

* There is a conflict with renesas-pinmux-for-v3.12,
  which I have previously sent a pull-request for,
  in arch/arm/boot/dts/r8a7740.dtsi.

I have provided an example of how to merge these as part of
the renesas-devel-20180807 tag in the renesas tree.

  ARM: shmobile: r8a7740: Add TPU node to the device tree (2013-08-06 18:06:23 +0900)

----------------------------------------------------------------
Second round of Renesas ARM-based SoC DT updates for v3.12

* Add TPU node to the device tree of r8a7740 SoC

* Enable nfsroot in the device tree of the lager baord

* Use device tree to initialise GIC on armadillo800eva and marzen boards

* Mount root file systems in r/w mode for all Renesas boards

* Add PMU information to .dtsi for the emev2, sh73a0 and r8a7740 SoCs

* Rely on DT for SMP CPU info on the sh73a0 and r8a7779 SoCs

* Switch marzen board to use DT_MACHINE_START
  - This is was the last the last board in the tree

* Add DT reference for ape6evm, lager and bockw boards
  - This is intended as method to develop DT coverage for these
    boards and their associated SoCs while leaving the existing mostly-C
    version of the code in place. This allows a clear distinction to be
    made between DT work and hardware support. And once the DT coverage is
    complete the mostly-C code can be removed.
  - This pattern is already used for a number of Renesas boards including
    the kzm9g and marzen.
