Yeah, I am not sure if it is likely that we will be able to convert
all platforms at v3.12 timing.

I actually tried to let common clocks and sh-clk coexist when the
common clock framework was under heavy development. I recall it being
far from trivial.

One possible way to develop this could be to force the mach-shmobile
"reference DT" implementations use common clocks and keep the old
boards as-is. Then we can also make sure the "reference DT"
implementations can be used as CONFIG_ARCH_MULTIPLATFORM. So if we
only have "reference DT" code as MULTIPLATFORM and then finally kill
off the old board code one by one.

I see, that makes sense. Thanks.

Since we're on the topic of CONFIG_ARCH_MULTIPLATFORM, do you have any
recommendatoin about LPAE?

Judging by the ARM_LPAE help text it seems that selecting ARM_LPAE
will result in a kernel only working on LPAE hardware:

config ARM_LPAE
[snip]
          Say Y if you have an ARMv7 processor supporting the LPAE page
          table format and you would like to access memory beyond the
          4GB limit. The resulting kernel image will not run on
          processors without the LPA extension.

With the above text it sounds to me like we should not to a "select
ARM_LPAE" on each board in the case of CONFIG_ARCH_MULTIPLATFORM.

I sort of expect LPAE to behave similar to x86 PAE. At least the board
DT file should describe all physical memory available and depending on
kernel configuration (HIGHMEM=y/n, LPAE=y/n) we get different amounts
of usable memory in the kernel. Then if LPAE should be selected or not
is something that the distributions have to decide.

Thanks!
