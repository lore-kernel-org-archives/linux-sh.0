Sure. The patch looks right to me :)

Yup, this one should have reg and device_type added.

I'm not sure what the deal is with v7 UP hardware. For v6 and below, the lack
of an MPIDR means there's nothing to describe. On v7 we should have an MPIDR
with Aff fields at least, so there is something to describe (even if we don't
use this currently). I don't believe this would cause any problems, and it
would make the dts look consistent.

I've Cc'd Lorenzo in case he has any thoughts on the matter.
