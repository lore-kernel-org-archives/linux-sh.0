I've thought about this as well. The IPMMU indeed provides two different 
functions, so drivers/mfd/ could be a candidate. This being said, both the 
IOMMU function and the PMB function are related to virtual memory space 
management, so they're not totally unrelated. I agree that the PMB function 
isn't really an IOMMU in the sense that it will likely not be exposed through 
the existing IOMMU API.

However, drivers/iommu/ seems to me like a more natural place to store the 
IPMMU driver compared to drivers/mfd/. Enabling IOMMU support 
(CONFIG_IOMMU_SUPPORT) doesn't mean the IOMMU core (CONFIG_IOMMU_API) will be 
compiled in. There would thus be no extra code compiled in if the IOMMU 
function of the IPMMU is disabled.
