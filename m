We normally prefer to see drivers separately from DT. If you've looked at how
we organize arm-soc, you've maybe seen that we have a separate topic for
next/driver and one for next/dt. In other words, we try to keep them apart
where it makes sense.

In this case, that would mean having the clk changes in a drivers branch, and
include that in this dt4 branch.

If you want a reminder for when you might have looked at the branch sorting
wrong: If you're naming the branch after a feature instead of the type of
patches in it (when you send it to us), then chances are that we would ideally
like to see the contents sorted differently -- at least in the cases where they
cross the category boundaries that we organize our tree in.

So, while it's not a huge deal I think it makes sense to revisit this
and do that sorting for consistency's sake. Can I please ask that you
respin this pull request with that in mind? I'd cherry-pick them apart
but I know you tend to base branches on each other so that might mess
you up and I don't want to do that.


Thanks,
