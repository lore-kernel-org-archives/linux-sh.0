Magnus asked me to detail the changes that I needed to make to make SMP
kzm9g reference work. I can do so in two words: disable CONFIG_PREEMPT.

The first patch in this series makes that changes.

The 4th patch in the series adds SMP ops to the sh73a0 DT_MACHINE_START
which adds SMP support when booting an sh73a0 based board using DT without
a board file compiled into the kernel. This has been tested with the kzm9g
board.

I consider the remaining patches clean-ups.
