To clarify, PSCI and MCPM are unrelated. It was originally conceived
that MCPM would use PSCI as a backend, but it turns out that they're
effectively mutually exclusive, and are handled separately. I still want
to add support for MIGRATE in the PSCI client code, but this is
independent of MCPM.

In some cases it's possible to determine at boot time that a CPU cannot
be hotplugged (e.g. in PSCI if the TOS is non-migrateable), so having
separate hooks for determining that static and dynamic ability to
hotplug a CPU sounds reasonable to me.

Thanks,
Mark.
