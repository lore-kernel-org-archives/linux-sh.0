Pulled, thanks.
It looks good to me, as far as I can tell.
Just the first commits that were not your own ones should have had more verbose
commit messages and I think they should have had your Signed-off as you received
them via e-mail?

And on another note:
Would you mind adding yourself as maintainer of drivers/video/sh_mobile_* in
MAINTAINERS? I can't find any entry for it yet and having me as primary source
for review for a driver I don't know is a bad idea, at least if there are people
that know it better.


Thanks,

Florian Tobias Schandinat
