Actually it gets the memory resource from the 'reg' property instead
of parsing the 'ranges' property, which of course is not compliant
with the generic PCI binding.

It also sets up an I/O resource that is located at the same location
as the memory resource, which is just a bug but might be used to
work around problems of the PCI core when no I/O resource is present.

I think that should be fixed.

I also see that the ranges parser in the pcie-rcar driver still gets
I/O space wrong, we should probably move that to a common range
parser once the arm64 pci implementation is in place and we can
share more of the common helpers.
