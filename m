I have also sighted them in linux-next.
So I expect they will show up in v3.13-rc1 or thereabouts.

Thanks, I have been able to successfully test all 4 patches in this
series with those settings enabled.

Thanks.

As it stands the defconfig for both APE6EVM and Lager lead to a
configuration with LPAE disabled, although neither explicitly disable LPAE.
I think it is best to leave things as-is in this regards and explicitly
disable LPAE in the defconfigs if the need arises.

While looking over this I noticed that the APE6EVM defconfig selects
HIGHMEM while the Lager defconfig does not and it is not selected in the
resulting config. Would it be worth updating the Lager defconfig to enable
HIGHMEM? If so, I'll make a patch.
