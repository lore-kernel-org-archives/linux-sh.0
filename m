I was actually planning to test the code on the Koelsch board. I don't want to 
step on anyone's toes, so please let me know if someone is already working on 
CCF patches for M2, otherwise I'll send them.

Z2 is a fixed factor clock, I'll just add it to DT.

Z is a bit more tricky. It's the output of a pure multiplier (PLL0) followed 
by a pure divisor (SYS-CPU divider 1). I can easily model the two as separate 
clock devices, but I'm unsure about what should be done at runtime when 
setting the Z clock frequency. Would it be enough to have a fixed PLL0 
frequency and configure the SYS-CPU divider 1 only (from 1/1 to 1/32), or 
would we need to configure the PLL0 multiplier as well for a more fine-grained 
Z frequency configuration ?
