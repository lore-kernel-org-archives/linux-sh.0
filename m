My understanding is that neither Magnus nor I have access to the
documentation for the sh7757. Thus we could only infer things from
examining the source code. I would be very happy if someone with access to
the documentation could shed some further light on this. In particular,
I would be happy if this heuristic was shown not to be necessary. But
in lieu of access to the documentation I think this patch is reasonable.
