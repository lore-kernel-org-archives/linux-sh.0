I'm personally fine with both. However, when using a version number, the 
format is ${vendor},${unit}-${version}. As we don't have an IP core version 
number we use the SoC name instead, so ${vendor},${unit}-${soc} would make 
sense. We should probably decide on one of the two alternatives and document 
it.
