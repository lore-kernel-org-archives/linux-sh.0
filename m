Thanks for your patches!

I'm afraid you can't call pm_runtime_get_sync() from these methods, as
they may be called from interrupt context.
BTW, I ran into similar issues with rcar-gpio, when trying to improve its
Runtime PM handling (still have to finish my WIP).

On r8a73a4/ape6evm, I now get during boot:

Unfortunately pm_runtime_get_sync() doesn't protect against s2ram.
pm_clk_suspend() will be called anyway, disabling the clock if it wasn't
enabled explicitly. That's why I incremented the clock's enable count manually
when wake-up is enabled.

During the suspend phase, it does:

Woops, wake-up by IRQC won't work anymore as the IRQC clock is now disabled.
