Hm, is exporting the clock object really better than doing a=20
'clk_get(NULL, "name")'?

I'll remove the last entry.

Ok, I can re-add the test and just add a line

		clk->rate =3D pllc2_recalc(clk);

in pllc2_enable()? This even makes sense in a way - if we know, that=20
after enabling the ->rate can get out of sync with the actual frequency... =

I'll prepare an updated patch to make it easier to see.

Thanks
