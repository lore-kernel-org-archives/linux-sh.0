Thanks for your help with the patches! You are right that these are
never used outside mach-shmobile, and moving headers out of "mach"
certainly makes sense.

For multiplatform we do currently work around the issue by the
following line in the Makefile:

ccflags-$(CONFIG_ARCH_MULTIPLATFORM) :-I$(srctree)/arch/arm/mach-shmobile/include

Thanks,
