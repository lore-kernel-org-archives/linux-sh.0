The frequency of the EXTAL on APE6EVM machine is 26MHz, and the Generic
Timers are clocked at EXTAL x1/2 (MHz).  Do not copy-and-paste wrong
clock-frequency properties currently we have, but fix cpu0 along with
adding cpu1..3, please.

Furthermore you don't have (should not) to use clock-frequency property
if you set up CNTFRQ to an appropriate value one by one in PATCH 05/05.
