According to the SH7757 manual, setting the CLKDIV[3:0] in the CE_CLK_CTRL register 0xF selects Pck as the bus clock frequency. So, unlike other devices where Pck/2 (CLKDIV[3:0]=0) is the max bus speed, the SH7757 can run at Pck when CLKDIV=0xF.

My understanding is that neither Magnus nor I have access to the
documentation for the sh7757. Thus we could only infer things from
examining the source code. I would be very happy if someone with access to
the documentation could shed some further light on this. In particular,
I would be happy if this heuristic was shown not to be necessary. But
in lieu of access to the documentation I think this patch is reasonable.
