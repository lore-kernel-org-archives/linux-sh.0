Hi Olof, Hi Kevin, Hi Arnd,

Please consider these fourth round of Renesas ARM based SoC DT updates for v4.3.

As requested by Olof, this is a repost of patches broken out of a now
defunct pull-request, "Renesas ARM Based SoC CPG MSTP Clock Domain Updates
for v4.3".  The motivation being to have driver changes in a separate
branch to DT changes.


This pull request is based on a merge of:

* "Renesas ARM Based SoC CPG/MSTP Clock Driver Updates for v4.3",
  tagged as renesas-clk-for-v4.3, which I have also sent a pull request for.

  The patches in this pull request depend on driver changes in
  renesas-clk-for-v4.3.

* "Third Round of Renesas ARM Based SoC DT Updates for v4.3",
  tagged as renesas-dt3-for-v4.3, which you have already merged.

  The patches in this pull request update nodes added by patches
  present in renesas-dt3-for-v4.3.


The following changes since commit 3f3f0ea0afe031ca20e48a212f4faa00f9920450:

  Merge branch 'clk-for-v4.3' into dt-for-v4.3 (2015-08-12 11:15:19 +0900)

are available in the git repository at:
