Sorry for having been absent from this discussion for so long. I didn't
realize there were 9 versions of this patch set.

I tend to agree with your interpretation above, but I may be missing
important facts from the previous review rounds.

For all I can tell, the binding is an attempt to describe the
entire drivers/sh/intc capabilities, which is probably not the
best way to approach things. The sh intc driver is not just an
irqchip driver, but rather a framework to describe arbitrary
irqchips, which is what makes this so hard.

When I first looked at the situation last year, I suggested doing
a new irqchip driver with a much simpler binding that can only
handle the irq chips from shmobile, rather than the whole thing.

I am not sure if the binding in the current form is already the
"simplified" version, or if it actually implements all the
capabilities of the intc driver.

Agreed, it would be simpler to have e.g. #interrupt-cells = <4>, to describe
the various offsets when needed (I forgot how many are actually required
in practice, rather than being computable from the other numbers), and
possibly a global interrupt-map/interrupt-map-mask property pair to map
this into a flat number space.

I need to take some more time to understand the actual requirements again,
but IIRC it would be possible to do something much simpler than the
proposed binding.
