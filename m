So one concern that I have about this is in regards to sharing ICBs with
user-space drivers.  Since there are user space drivers (via UIO) for
blocks like the VEU, that may want to have access to MERAM, we need
a way to communicate which ICBs are free to user space.  With the
hard-coded platform data we could easily assume that kernel drivers
would use, for example, the upper 16 ICBs and so user-space drivers were
free to use the lower 16.

One simple temporary workaround might be to provide a range of useable
ICBs in the platform data.  The MERAM memory allocation range can always
easily be tweaked by using the meram_resources structure.

Thanks,
Damian
