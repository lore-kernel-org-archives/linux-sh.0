Anyone looking up clks on the fly really should think more carefully
about this, as it is firstly possible to be an expensive operation on
systems with multiple clocks, and secondly, in my view, stupid.

I would vote for all clk lookup and reference counting code be made
sleep-able and define it as such.

And we fall into another problem here, if we set_parent of a clock,
which causes one clock to start and another to stop, then what
happens with non-atomic clocks?

if not, we're going to have drivers either keeping clocks on all
the time, or having to put duplicated enable/set-parent/disable
logic in all over the place.
