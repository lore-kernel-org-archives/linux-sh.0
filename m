So, why have the DMA memory mapped in _correctly_ by dma_alloc_coherent(),
and then have dma_declare_coherent_memory() map it in using ioremap(),
thereby creating an incompatible DEVICE aliasing mapping of the already
existing memory mapping.

This definitely falls outside of predicatible behaviour on ARMv6 and
ARMv7, and doesn't even fall within the limits of the mitigated
conditions for existing CPUs.

The above will _not_ work reliably.  Good, my patch has identified
something that's definitely broken.

Sounds like a sane approach to fixing this to me.
