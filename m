Right. Or multiple values.

Ah, so you have multiple values, too, and you just abstract them by using
an enum to index an array of platform_data in the dma engine.

This obviously works as well, and lets you get away with a single 32-bit
enum to use as the slave-id. However, I think slave drivers should not
be written with the assumption that all dma-engine drivers do this.
In particular, you seem to assume that the argument to the filter function
is not a pointer but this enum.

It also gets more complicated with the DT binding, since that should
reflect the hardware settings, i.e. not an arbitrarily defined enum
but the data that you have in your array. To keep the DT and platform_data
cases similar, I would suggest you actually remove the array listing
the per-slave data, and move that data instead as an opaque pointer into
the platform data. You can take a look at drivers/mmc/host/mmci.c for
an example of a driver that does this and that is portable across
multiple DMA engine drivers.

Essentially we pass the dma_filter function and dma_param struct pointers
to dma_request_channel directly from the platform_data, without trying
to interpret them. In case of stedma40, the dma_param contains a complex
data structure, while for others it may contain a single integer.

If you do the same, you would essentially pass the mid_rid and chcr values
of your sh_dmae_slave_config as in the pointer that gets passed from
the platform_data down to the filter function, get rid of the slave_id
number and pass the addr value through slave_config.
