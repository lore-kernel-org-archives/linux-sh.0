I think that the best approach would be for
a) me to remove the patches in question from your tree
b) you to send fresh patches, perhaps the USB ones need
   to go through another tree (= other than my renesas tree)
c) I will send a fresh pull request.

I am guessing this may take a little time. If so, as the end of opportunity
to get fresh code into 3.7 is approaching I may post an intermediate pull
request that omits the USB changes.
