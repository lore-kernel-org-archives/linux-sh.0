Hello.

   Here's the set of 9 patches against the Simon Horman's 'renesas.git' repo,
'renesas-next-20130405v2' tag.  It was created to fix the shortcomings in the
R8A7779/Marzen USB platform code and R8A7779 USB common PHY driver, and so
spans both arch/arm/mach-shmobile/ and drivers/usb/ subtrees (some patches have
to touch both subtrees). The patches were conceived with the complete
bisectability goal in mind. The patches have been tested on the Marzen board.

[1/9] ARM: shmobile: Marzen: move USB EHCI, OHCI, and PHY devices to R8A7779 code
[2/9] ehci-platform: add pre_setup() method to platform data
[3/9] ARM: shmobile: R8A7779: setup EHCI internal buffer
[4/9] rcar-phy: remove EHCI internal buffer setup
[5/9] ARM: shmobile: R8A7779: remove USB PHY 2nd memory resource
[6/9] rcar-phy: correct base address
[7/9] rcar-phy: add platform data
[8/9] ARM: shmobile: Marzen: pass platform data to USB PHY device
[9/9] rcar-phy: handle platform data

   I'm not sure thru which tree this patchset should be merged, however it turns
out that it's too late now to push it thru Felipe Balbi's USB tree for 3.10 which
would have been most convenient probably, so maybe the patchset can be merged
thru Simon's tree with Felipe's and Alan Stern's ACKs. Or perhaps it now should
be postponed for 3.11...

WBR, Sergei
