Sorry, it fell through the cracks.

I think these should be "sd2"...

... and "sd3", as they refer to the clock signals from the clock generator,
and thus should match the register and label names.

(Note: The (old) R-Car E2 v0.1 datasheet does call them SD1 and SD2 :-(

These are disputable: the MSTP docs indeed call them SDHI3, SDHI2, and
SDHI0 (in the latest R-Car Gen2 family datasheet revision).
But for all(?) other MSTP clocks they match the actual module instances
that are driven by the clocks.
So I think these should stay "sdhi2", "sdhi1", and "sdhi0", as they refer to
the SDHI instances, not the parent clocks.

At least we should be consistent with the R8A7794_CLK_SDHIx indices,
which are 2, 1, and 0, not 3, 2, 0.
