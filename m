This looks suspicious. Are you're purposefully deflating the rating so
that the STI timer fills in the broadcast position? Why not make the STI
cpumask be all possible CPUs? Presumably the interrupt can target all
CPUs since it isn't a per-cpu interrupt and doing this would cause the
STI to fill in the broadcast slot, leaving the per-cpu dummys in the
tick position.
