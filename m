Yes, Maxime got the XIP fix for scripts/link-vmlinux.sh into the kernel ([PATCH v6 01/15] scripts: link-vmlinux: Don't pass page offset to kallsyms if XIP Kernel), which of course made one less file I have to patch.

The part I'm using (RZ/A1H) is a Cortex A9 and the EFM32 is a Cortex M3, so we'd be able to test both MMU and non-MMU XIP systems.
