I count integrator-cp, realview, versatile and non-DT VExpress that do
this (not surprisingly) and 25 platforms or timer implementations plus
arm64 that do sched_clock setup in time_init. What's broken by not
moving these earlier?

We could probably fix arch timers relatively easily, but supporting the
numerous memory-mapped timers will be harder. Most timers are also
dependent on the clocks being initialized. That's really an orthogonal
issue to what this patch series solves. This series is about selecting
the best sched_clock when multiple timers are present. Perhaps one that
is setup in init_early should be preferred over one setup in init_time.
I'm not sure how to detect that.
