One of us probably is :-)

I'd have to recheck whether this is really a standard behaviour, but the PFC 
driver at least supports setting both functions and configuration as far as I 
can tell. The relevant example from the PFC bindings is

        mmcif_pins: mmcif {
                mux {
                        renesas,groups = "mmc0_data8_0", "mmc0_ctrl_0";
                        renesas,function = "mmc0";
                };
                cfg {
                        renesas,groups = "mmc0_data8_0";
                        renesas,pins = "PORT279";
                        bias-pull-up;
                };
        };

It's a bit more verbose than I'd like, but I think the following should work 
too.

        mmcif_pins: mmcif {
                renesas,groups = "mmc0_data8_0";
                renesas,function = "mmc0";
                bias-pull-up;
        };

(it requires all pins from the groups to use the same configuration though)

I believe the former is the intended way to set both function and config, 
while the latter is a PFC "extension".

On a side note, I have a patch to support the standard "groups", "functions" 
and "pins" properties instead of the Renesas-specific versions, I'll try to 
revive it.
