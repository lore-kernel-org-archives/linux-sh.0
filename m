Hi Olof, Hi Kevin, Hi Arnd,

Please consider these second round of Renesas ARM based SoC fixes for v3.19.

This pull request is based on the previous round of
such requests, tagged as renesas-soc-fixes-for-v3.19,
which you have already pulled into your fixes branch.

This fixes a regression in the r8a7779 and r8a7779 SoCs due to
9a1091ef0017c40a ("irqchip: gic: Support hierarchy irq domain.")
which was included in v3.18-rc2.


The following changes since commit b0ddb319db3d7a1943445f0de0a45c07a7f3457a:
