I'm using the normal definition of LP64 which is "long and pointer are
both exactly 64-bits", not "long fits in pointer" or "long and pointer
are same size".

Yes, if there's a lot of arch-specific infrastructure for boot time
setup, platform devices, behavior of mmu and cache, etc. that's the
same for 32- and 64-bit "variants" of an arch, and especially if the
32-bit variant is mostly a legacy userspace that actually runs on
64-bit hardware that's capable of doing both, then there's a good
argument for having them use a shared tree. That last part makes sense
for SH -- I think we'd certainly want 32-bit userspace to be able to
run on a 64-bit kernel. But it seems like it's possible to split that
across archs since ARM did.

Really it's sort of a historical accident/misfactoring that
"user-to-kernel interface for ISA X" and "kernel internals for the
machine arch using ISA X" are conflated as the same thing. If this had
been done in a more clean manner the "compat syscall" stuff wouldn't
be such a mess.
