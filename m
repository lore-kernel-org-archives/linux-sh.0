I'd differ on the last sentence. It's more important to straighten out
the release features for 4.4 than to make sure that linux-next has
perfect DTS files. So I'll submit whenever ready :)

FWIW, I plan to submit my pullreq this week, hopefully by
end-of-Wednesday. (There are other potential MTD fixes that haven't
stabilized. I may just send them separately.)

Regards,
Brian
