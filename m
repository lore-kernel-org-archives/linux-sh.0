Thank you - appreciated!

The CMT timer is built into various SoCs from Renesas, often multiple
instances of it. Each timer instance has 6 channels. You can select if
they are driven by the main clock or the real time clock (the SoCs
include an SH core for data processing) and can use different subscale
modes. It features free running mode and can fire events. The clock
has up to 48 bits to count. It has a DMA channel and wires enabling
the device to be a wakeup source. Hmm don't know what to add more.
It's a timer - you can check for overflows, read the counter and so
on.

That's true - they don't describe the hardware. It's a policy how the
device should be used. Here: Register it as clocksource *and*
eventsource. I don't know if there is a use case when we want only 1
of them.

Oh yes nice! I will convert these calls.

Oh true. Jeeez - this very much looks like exploitable code. If
someone manages to change the boot config...
Whatever - I'll add a check.

Will do.
