Hi,

this series adds support to r8a7793 and gose device trees for:
* i2c and iic
* rcar sound: first in PIO mode then using DMA

i2c support is a pre-requisite for rcar sound support.

Unfortunately there appears to be some problem with DMA
for rcar sound that I have been unable to track down. On booting I see:

rcar_sound ec500000.sound: dma allocate failed
rcar_sound ec500000.sound: ssi[0] fallback to PIO mode
rcar_sound ec500000.sound: ssi[1] fallback to PIO mode
rcar_sound ec500000.sound: probed

I would appreciate any insights regarding the above.

I have been unable to test if audio works (in PIO mode) as I
do not have physical access to a gose board. I would appreaciate
some assistance there too.

This work is based heavily on the work of others for the r8a7791 and
koelsch.  as noted in the changelogs of individual patches.

This series is based on renesas-devel-20151211-v4.4-rc4.
