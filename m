Hm, perhaps it can be done with incremental patches in the future?

I think it's good to be consistent and use the same argument passing
style as other callbacks, but at the same time I'm not 100% sure if
passing a platform data pointer is the best approach. It probably made
sense with the old tmio_mmc driver that only hooked up to MFD, but I'm
not sure if that's the case anymore. I'm sure there is room for plenty
of cleanups - but exactly what to do I don't know. =3D)

At least passing a struct tmio_mmc_host * requires little conversion
which should add minimal overhead.

No, not at all. I just recall someone pointing out that
tmio_mmc_enable_dma() skipped the tmio_mmc specific I/O routines and
used writew() directly. I suspected the reason behind this was the
difficulty of converting between different pointer types, but that may
not be true.

Ok, that's good.

Hm, perhaps it's my mail setup that's the issue, but the version of
"[PATCH 1/5] mmc: tmio: name 0xd8 as CTL_DMA_ENABLE" that I'm looking
at is still using writew().
