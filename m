Hi Simon,

I have now tested patch "[PATCH] ARM: shmobile: r8a73a4: add thermal
driver support" on real hardware.

I have exercised this patch by applying the following patches on top
of renesas-next-20130321:
[PATCH] ARM: shmobile: Disallow PINCTRL without GPIOLIB
[PATCH 00/04] ARM: shmobile: r8a73a4 SoC support V3
[PATCH 01/04] ARM: shmobile: Initial r8a73a4 SoC support V3
[PATCH 02/04] ARM: shmobile: r8a73a4 SCIF support V3
[PATCH 03/04] ARM: shmobile: r8a73a4 IRQC support V2
[PATCH 04/04] ARM: shmobile: r8a73a4 PFC support
[PATCH] ARM: shmobile: r8a73a4: add thermal driver support

Judging by the patch list above I believe you can just throw this
patch in on top of the "r8a73a4 SoC V3" patches.

As Morimoto-san explained, there are some runtime dependencies related
to various bug fixes in the thermal driver. But for merging and
compiling I believe the above should be enough.

Thanks,

/ magnus
