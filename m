No, DCS is a spec of its own. DCS can be used on non-DSI displays also.
For example N800 and N900 use DCS commands, but they are not DSI
displays.

Well, true, this is not a clear thing. MIPI DSI spec talks about "turn
on peripheral command". But the numbers are DSI data types, according to
the spec, and not all of them are commands.

I don't know, but mixing different formats looks ugly to me =).

I think a simple solution would be to just use defines, and have
functions that take the command as u8. That's what the OMAP DSI driver
does. If you have better ideas, please share =).

The same applies for the DSI commands/datatypes, although I haven't seen
a panel that has custom DSI datatypes.
