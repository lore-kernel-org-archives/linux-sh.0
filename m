Hello,

This patch set cleans up and fixes small issues in the ipmmu-vmsa driver. The
patches are based on top of "[PATCH v3] iommu: Add driver for Renesas
VMSA-compatible IPMMU" that adds the ipmmu-vmsa driver.

The most interesting part of this series is the rewrite of the page table
management code. The IOMMU core guarantees that the map and unmap operations
will always be called only with page sizes advertised by the driver. We can
use that assumption to remove loops of PGD and PMD entries, simplifying the
code.

Joerg, is there still time to get this merged in v3.16 ? The patches have all
been posted previously and the only comment I've received was about a missing
#define in patch 04/10.
