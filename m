My apologies for the confusing commit message!

There is currently no problem with XIP=n, however to support XIP=y the
temporary stack needs to move into the data section. My plan is doing
that regardless of if XIP is enabled or not, but that makes the XIP=n
case a bit more complex.

If we move the stack into the data section then the "adr" instruction
may no longer be able to perform PC-relative addressing. Which
requires a rework of the code to not rely on "adr". That in turn
requires us to handle that the MMU is disabled. And unless I'm
mistaken the executing environment in case of XIP=n may not execute at
the actual link address, so because of an offset adjustment
calculation is also mandatory.

Sure, will do! Apart from that, do you agree with the offset
calculation and the duplication of the code? I'd be happy to rework
things if needed.

Thanks,
