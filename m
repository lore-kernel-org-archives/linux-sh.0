In my experience it helps to have the patches split out for two reasons:
1. If there is a problem on one board its patch can be reverted without
   having to bother with making a partial revert in order to leave the
   other boards alone.
2. It makes backporting easier in the case where there is interest in
   one board but not another.

Moreover, the boards are separate entities and in general I would
like their patches to be separate. The same goes for SoCs.

I realise this is more fine-grained than what other maintainers prefer
but it is an approach that seems to work well for us.
