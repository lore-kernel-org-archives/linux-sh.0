These patches add support for DMA, MMCIF and SDHI controllers to non-DT 
APE6EVM and Lager board implementations, and MMCIF and SDHI DT templates 
for APE6 and H2 SoCs.

A note concerning SDHI OF compatibility strings. Patch 5 of this series 
adds OF compatibility strings for sh73a0, r8a73a4, r8a7790 to make it 
possible to use correct SoC names instead of a supposedly compatible one. 
Patches 6 and 7 then use those names in SDHI DT templates on r8a73a4 and 
r8a7790. This doesn't directly impose a commit order dependency, since 
those templates are added in a disabled state. Therefore these patches 
can be pushed upstream via different git-trees. Only when specific boards 
enable SDHI interfaces in their .dts files, only then will it be 
important to have both respective patches in the kernel: the drivers/mmc 
patch and the respective SoC .dtsi patch. It is therefore proposed to 
push these patches to 3.12 and to begin enabling SDHI interfaces in 
respective board .dtsi files from 3.13. Also note, that sh73a0 is already 
using "renesas,r8a7740-sdhi" compatibility in its .dtsi. After patch 5 
this still will work, but it also will become possible to use a more 
obvious "renesas,sh73a0-sdhi" OF compatibility string.

Developed and tested on top of Simon's renesas.git next snapshot of
08.07.2013.
