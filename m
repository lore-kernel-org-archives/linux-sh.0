Hi all and in particular Sergei,

elsewhere in this thread Sergei indicated that he felt that
the spin lock around reading host->wait_for in sh_mmcif_irqt() doesn't
"seem to have much sense here, as the read is already atomic."

My initial reaction was that remark was correct. However, Kaneko-san
has done some further analysis which I would now like to share. My
apologies if in advance if I have misinterpreted that analysis.

We could get an interrupt here.

And without the locking that this patch proposes if an interrupt did occur
at the point noted above then we may cancel work that has not yet been
scheduled. And furthermore the work will subsequently be scheduled and
never canceled.

And without the locking proposed by this patch if an interrupt occurred
at the point annotated above then host->wait_for may be read before it
is set by sh_mmcif_start_cmd().
