I checked the details about the runtime PM support in the driver. To
me, it seems there are some additional pieces missing.

For a short while, let's just ignore the behaviour of the generic PM
domain. Then I would suggest to add the following below to the driver.
Please tell me if you think I am wrong, I don't no much about ALSA and HDMI. :-)

1) Add a runtime PM suspend callback to:
- Save register context.
- Enable wakeup IRQ if "wakeup IRQ capabilities" is set.

2) Add a runtime PM resume callback to:
- Restore register context.
- Disable wakeup IRQ.

3) Add a system PM suspend callback to:
- Disable "wakeup IRQ capabilities".
- Put the device into low power state.
Could likely be done by:
    pm_runtime_get_sync();
    "disable wakeup irq cap";
    pm_runtime_put();
    pm_runtime_force_suspend();

4) Add a system PM resume callback to:
- Enable "wakeup IRQ capabilities".
- Restore power to the device.
Could likely be done by:
    "enable wakeup irq_cap";
    pm_runtime_force_resume();

5) Currently the ->probe() method invokes pm_runtime_get_sync(),
causing the runtime PM resume callbacks to be invoked in this path.
Unless I am missing a point, this will cause the device stay runtime
PM resumed all the time. Is that really what you want?


In this context, and what I am trying to understand, is what changes
are needed to the generic PM domain, such it can be used under these
circumstances.

Kind regards
