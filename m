Hi Kevin,

Thanks for your review. Yes, we can do like this and it would prevent
duplication of code. I just wanted to make cpuidle handle only selection
and entering of state, and leave everything else to the driver which
knows best about these things.

But both are functionally same and definitely statistics update inside
cpuidle_idle_call() prevents duplication of code.

Thanks,
