I will take it, but at the moment I'm rather unhappy about the response
from the community to Linus' complaint.

If existing platform maintainers can show that moving over to this will
result in a net reduction of code under arch/arm, then that will be good.
What I don't want to see at the moment is arch/arm increasing in size as
a result of any change.  We desperately need to see a reduction for the
next merge window.
