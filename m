No issues with the patch, but here are few comments on the core
reasons (without looking at the code in this case) that might help
fix similar issues.

In all the cases I've seen these errors are caused by non-standard
custom initcall levels for drivers like i2c bus. The real solution
is to initialize drivers later with standard module_init, and stop
the race to the bottom with custom initcall levels.

If there is legacy board specific platofrm init code that needs
i2c gpios early, that code can probably be moved to initialize
later on.

Also, there should not be any need for custom driver initcall
levels from Linux generic framework point of view as for example
irqchip implementing drivers work just fine as a loadable module.

Tony
