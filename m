Hi Olof, Hi Kevin, Hi Arnd,

Please consider these Renesas ARM based SoC GIC cleanup for v4.5.

This pull-request includes staging-board changes which have been
acked by Greg Kroah-Hartman. They are bundled into this pull-request
as not-doing so would break the drivers they update.

The following changes since commit 8005c49d9aea74d382f474ce11afbbc7d7130bec:

  staging: board: armadillo800eva: Use "arm,pl390" (2015-12-18 10:21:10 +0900)

----------------------------------------------------------------
Renesas ARM Based SoC GIC Cleanup for v4.5

On several Renesas ARM SoCs, the GIC is described in DT as being a
Cortex A9 GIC, while it's actually a PL390. This is not only stated in
the documentation, but has been verified by reading the GICD_IIDR
register.

To correct this:
  1. Update the DT compatible value to match reality,
  2. Update the board staging drivers to match the above.
