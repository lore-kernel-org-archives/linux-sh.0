Hi Olof, Hi Kevin, Hi Arnd,

Please consider these Renesas ARM based SoC DT fixes for v3.18.
Or alternatively for v3.19 if you feel they are too late for v3.18.


* ARM: shmobile: r8a7740 dtsi: Correct IIC0 parent clock

  This problem was introduced when clock support was added DT for the
  r8a7740 by d9ffd583bf345e2ea ("ARM: shmobile: r8a7740: add SoC clocks to
  DTS") in v3.18-rc1.

  I am not aware of any run-time effect of this problem.

* ARM: shmobile: r8a7790: Fix SD3CKCR address to device tree

  This problem was introduced when clock support was added DT for the
  r8a7790 by 22a1f59547e1e63cd ("ARM: shmobile: r8a7790: Add clocks")
  in v3.13.

  As there is no SD card slot for SDHI3 on the lager board there is no
  run-time effect of this problem on boards supported in mainline.


The following changes since commit f114040e3ea6e07372334ade75d1ee0775c355e1:
