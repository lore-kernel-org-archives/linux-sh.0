Why can't we have that new function, clk_setup or whatever, a part of new API?
For now, it'll just be a place holder whit NULL as platform specific hooks.
Eventually platforms like Samsung will have that filled and others
keep that empty.
Only let it be defined for drivers to always call clk_setup at probe
and clk_enable when
needed.
Or am I overlooking something?
