Hi,

this series is a follow-up to "[PATCH v2 0/8] SH pinctrl DT support"
by Laurent Pinchart. I am primarily posting it for his review.

This series differs from the series posted by Laurent in that:

* I have added the following two patch to update the KZM9G reference code.

  ARM: shmobile: kzm9g: reference: Populate platform devices from device tree

The basis for this series is

  git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/horms/renesas.git topic/pinmux-pfc-funcs

  Which was posted as "[PATCH 00/21 v1.2] SCIF, I2C and FSI pinctrl
  functions for sh73a0" a little earlier today.

Laurent, if you want to change this series in any way just let me know.
I can drop patches indidually or drop the entire series and add a fresh
one from you to the topic branch.

Git and diffstat information is provided below to aid review.
