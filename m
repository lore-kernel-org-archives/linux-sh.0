I tend to agree. Adding functionality for functionality's sake really
only creates an undue maintenance burden. If there are LCDC blocks that
don't have IRQ lines, then of course we will have to do something like
this. If we're just waiting on patches to get upstream in order to enable
the IRQs then I don't really see the point -- there are out of tree
patches we're waiting on in both cases, so this can only really be
considered a stop-gap until the intcs patches are merged anyways,
especially since we'll still want to enable the IRQs on AP4 once those
patches are merged.
