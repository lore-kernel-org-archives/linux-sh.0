Yes we are ;-)

You already have drivers-for-v3.20 as a separate branch this depends on.
The remaining commits are mostly DTS, except for (1)

    ARM: shmobile: sh73a0: Introduce generic setup callback
    ARM: shmobile: sh73a0: Add Multiplatform support

and (1)

    ARM: shmobile: kzm9g-reference: Remove board C code and DT file

(1) could be done in an SoC support code branch, as (codewise) it's independent
from the rest.
(2) could be done in a board removal branch, but it's only a single commit.

From a functionality point of view, (1) (and all the rest in the branch) is a
dependency of (2), though.

So if no one complains, I'd leave it as-is. Splitting it up is not
gonna makes things
simpler when I submit my next series ;-)

Gr{oetje,eeting}s,

                        Geert
