I don't think we want to pull in net-next here just for this -- that is a
massive branch.

There's no great solution to any of this, unfortunately.

I think easiest would be if we add a patch that fixes this up _only_ in
for-next, and merge the same patch upstream as soon as net-next lands
(if it lands after arm-soc, otherwise we include it in our branch),
that might be the least painful way to do this.

That patch would just remove the assignment to register_type in the
board file.
