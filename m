I believe that this leaves mach-shmobile with three areas
where CONFIG_MEMORY_START/PLAT_PHYS_OFFSET is used.

* arch/arm/mach-shmobile/headsmp.S

  This uses PLAT_PHYS_OFFSET.

  I believe this can be replaced with a run-time calculation. Though I
  haven't thought about the details yet.

* arch/arm/boot/compressed/head-shmobile.S

  This makes use of CONFIG_MEMORY_START.

  This is only used if CONFIG_ZBOOT_ROM is set.

  I'm unsure if this can be replaced with a run-time calculation or not.
  But regardless it is only used if CONFIG_ZBOOT_ROM is set, which is not
  the default at this time.


* arch/arm/mach-shmobile/Makefile.boot

 This makes use of CONFIG_MEMORY_START to set zreladdr.

 I believe that the solution to this is to make use of CONFIG_AUTO_ZRELADDR.
 However, it is not yet clear to me how that can be used in conjunction
 with a uImage.  As I understand it the boot loader on many of our boards,
 including the Marzen board which is my first target for this work, boot
 uImage imagess.
