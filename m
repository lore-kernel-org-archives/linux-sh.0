Hi Olof, Hi Arnd,

As requested the first patch is now includes an ack from Greg Kroah-Hartman.

I have included the r8a7790 change in this patch as it
depends on the first change in the pull-request but nothing else.

This pull request will cause some conflicts though I believe all
of them are not difficult to resolve. The renesas-next-20130613 tag in
my tree illustrates how I have handled the conflicts with
both changes already in arm-soc and changes I intend to send
pull requests for in the near future.

The following changes since commit c7788792a5e7b0d5d7f96d0766b4cb6112d47d75:
