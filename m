Are we going to vote? :-)

Yes, sure, I realise that.

Hmm, I'm not sure to follow here. Firstly, I'm not sure why using both 
cannot classify as a fix, secondly, do you mean, that when using QoS we 
don't have to set the delay to 0? But with the delay left at 200ms PM QoS 
doesn't have much left to say?

Well, following this logic, we should not change the default in the 
driver, and just either ask to revert that commit or rely on user-space to 
set the delay to 0.

Do you think we should apply constraints to the mmc host class-device?... 
.parent is just a pointer to the actual underlying hardware device, the 
platform device in our case.
