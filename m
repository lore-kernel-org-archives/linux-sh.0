Hmmm, that's very weird - I rebased my patch series on top of your 
mmc-next from a couple of hours ago. Sorry for asking, but you've also 
applied the leading two patches from this series, right? This is what my 
log of this driver looks like now:

6bf5ca1 mmc: sh_mmcif: remove now superfluous sh_mmcif_host::data member
8777cc4 mmc: sh_mmcif: process requests asynchronously
0295d69 mmc: sh_mmcif: cosmetic clean up
74dfec8 mmc: sh_mmcif: process error interrupts first
9092a17 mmc: convert drivers/mmc/host/* to use module_platform_driver()

Thanks
Guennadi
