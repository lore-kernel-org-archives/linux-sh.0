Thank you for the review!

Yes, I will add the following comment.

The PWM timer of R-Car H2 has 7 channels. So, we can use the channels if we
describe device tree nodes.

I will fix it.

I will fix it.

I would like to avoid a "prohibition setting" when the PWM is enabled.
The datasheet said "setting 0x000 is prohibited" in CYC0 and PH0.
However, the initial value of each field is 0x000.
So, I am thinking this is truly the PWM can't be enabled.
If this driver sets any value to the register in probe() to avoid
"prohibition setting", I can remove the condtion in ->enable().
What do you think?

About the ->config(), it already has such a condition check by rcar_pwm_set_counter():

+	/* Avoid prohibited setting */
+	if (cyc && ph)
+		rcar_pwm_write(rp, cyc | ph, RCAR_PWMCNT);
+
+	return (cyc && ph) ? 0 : -EINVAL;

However it may be unreadable code. So, I will fix it as the followings:

+	/* Avoid prohibited setting */
+	if (cyc != 0 && ph != 0) {
+		rcar_pwm_write(rp, cyc | ph, RCAR_PWMCNT);
+		return 0;
+	} else {
+		return -EINVAL;
+	}

I will fix it.
