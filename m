That's true...

Enabling the USB network drivers is one thing I can easily do myself.
But I don't know on which boards they are used, and which USB host
controller drivers are needed.

P.S. Strange, USB_NET_DRIVERS is tristate, but setting it to "y" doesn't
     mean all USB network drivers become builtin, as USB_NET_DRIVERS is never
     used in a "depends" construct...

Gr{oetje,eeting}s,

In personal conversations with technical people, I call myself a hacker. But
when I'm talking to journalists I just say "programmer" or something like that.
