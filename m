Simon,

I've pulled this into next/boards (as renesas/boards), but I'd like to get an
understanding of how much more legacy board code you expect to add. I'd like to
see it slow down to nearly nothing as things move over to device tree, and I'm
a little confused that we've still got this much coming in.


Thanks!
