It should still work (as well as other archs). Does it have any
particular need for page table allocation speed compared to others?

I actually think it's more benefit for ia64 and sh than anything.
For other arches it's no big deal, and generic code just sprinkles
some poorly named function around the place with no real way to
know where it should go or test it. Then not to mention its
interaction with other memory queues.

Yeah, to some degree I agree. And if someone would test it on a modern
CPU and workload that would be cool.

But for example in most workloads you would expect the rate of page
allocation and freeing for processes to be on the same order of 
magnitude at the low end, up to 2 orders of magnitude higher than
page tables that map them. Not true perhaps for very large shared
mmaps, but all in all IMO it's not clear this is a good tradeoff, or
it's a good idea to proliferate these little queues around the place.

Anyway that's just handwaving from me, but I'm not against the code
being resurrected and added to the more important archs if it shows
good gains on something relevant.

Thanks,
Nick
