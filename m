That would also work.

The reasons I proposed cherry-picking were:
  1. A branch may be overkill for just one small commit, putting some
    burden on Mike,
  2. An rc release assumes Mike plans to send another pull request soon.

Anyway, the goal is to get this fixed in v3.15, whatever approach ;-)
