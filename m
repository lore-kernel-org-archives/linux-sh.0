Describe the PCI USB devices that are behind the PCI bridges, adding necessary
links to the USB PHY device.

Based on the original work by Ben Dooks <ben.dooks@codethink.co.uk>.

This patch is against 'renesas-devel-v3.14-20140408' tag of Simon Horman's
'renesas.git' repo plus R8A7790/Lager PCI and USB PHY support patches posted
yesterday and day before. The patch requires the internal PCI and USB PHY
drivers (also already posted) in order to work...
