Nope. In the patches Jeremy posted clocks have a name, but this name
is not meant to be used with clk_get. clk_get is still implemented
in clkdev, so the matching between clocks and devices is independent
of the clock name.

In earlier versions of Jeremys patches the clock name was only present
when debugfs was compiled in and I think it can be changed back to this.

That said the debugfs support (which is not present in Jeremys latest
series) would break if two clocks with the same name have the same
parent, because the clock core would try to create to debugfs entries
with the same name.
