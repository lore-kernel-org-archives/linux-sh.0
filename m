    Heh, yet I completely ignore the "commit signers" list that it has
a habit to spitting out. :-)

    OK, I'll try to make this distinction in the future. I just didn't 
think the
difference between To: and Cc: was really that important to anyone.

     Sorry about that.

    That would be somewhat tougher, as I'm usually quick to hit the send
button after completing the email, so can forget to change people from
To: list to CC: list... but I'll have to promise to try to give it more 
attention
from now on.
