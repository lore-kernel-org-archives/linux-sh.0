I'd like to help you to clarify whatever issues you are having, but I
don't have anyhardware access or schematics for the Silk board.

So here is some generic information. In general with SD/MMC I can
imagine a couple of different types of devices.

1) Hotpluggable SD socket (with write protect)
2) Hotpluggable micro-SD socket (no write protect)
3) On-board SD/MMC/SDIO (no hotplug, no write protect)

Which type of device that happens to be used on a particular board is
a board specific property. So on one board SDHI1 may be micro-SD but
on a different board SDHI1 may be a soldered-on eMMC or a SDIO module
(case 3). The same SoC DTSI will contain on-chip information for SDHI1
while the board specific DTS may contain optional information about WP
and CD signals.

On R-Car Gen2 we default to assume case 3 above which means no WP and
CD signals. If a regular SD socket is used then the board specific
file needs to point out CD and WP signals. For micro-SD sockets there
is no WP signal so in such case only the CD pin is needed.

HIstorically with SDHI the availability of CD and WP signals vary
wildly depending on SoC and SDHI instance. Also, with power domains
and Runtime PM we would like to be able to power off the power domain
for the SDHI device and still be able to wake up, so assigning CD and
WP as GPIO signals will not only allow board-specific stuff to be
cleanly separated from the on-chip SDHI DTSI, it also allows for
easier review and better power management.

Now what is the issue that you guys are having?

What needs to be updated for R-Car Gen1 again?
