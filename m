(diving into the documentation)

Yes, probably 36, 37, and 38. I say "probably", as I find it non-trivial
to convert from docs to DT.

What happens with 35, which is "TMU21 (input capture)"?
As DT describes the hardware, shouldn't it be mentioned here?

Likewise for "TMU51 (input capture)"?

In personal conversations with technical people, I call myself a hacker. But
when I'm talking to journalists I just say "programmer" or something like that.
