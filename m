Subject: [PATCH] ARM: shmobile: r8a7779: Add clock index macros for DT sources

Add macros usable by device tree sources to reference r8a7779 clocks by
index.

Based on work for the r8a7791 SoC by Laurent Pinchart.

Hi Mike,

as discussed elsewhere please consider this for v3.16.
It resolves the build-breakage caused by
7b42a99 ("clk: shmobile: r8a7779: Add clocks support").

I have tested that this does resolve the build problem
reported by Arnd by applying it on top of clk-next whose
current head is 42dd880 ("Merge branch 'clk-fixes' into clk-next").

As I am a little unsure of how to enable ARCH_R8A7779 and
ARCH_SHMOBILE_MULTI in clk-next I compiled it my modifying
drivers/clk/shmobile/Makefile to compile the driver if ARCH_R8A7790
is set and then compiled using the shmobile_defconfig.
