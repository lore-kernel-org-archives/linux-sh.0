By documenting the binding in that file it exists and may be used in DT
nodes. It may or may not be used by the driver now or in the future.

For better or worse this one way that bindings may be handled.

Strictly speaking it shouldn't be used in DT before it exists,
even only in the documentation. But in this case its just a minor
update to an existing scheme so it seems unlikely to be rejected.
