Thanks. =)

There are CPUFreq dependencies on SMP and multi-cluster frequency
scaling for some SoCs, so to begin with I prefer to allow selected
boards use whatever old interface that is available now and over time
incrementally improve the situation. I don't however want the shared
per-SoC DT_MACHINE code in setup-xxx.c to enable anything by default
for now though - this portion we can modify when we have SMP and
multi-cluster working.

Cheers,
