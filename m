The problem with doing that is I think the assigned-clocks and
assigned-clock-rates properties belong together.  I can't find any other
instance where they are split between a .dtsi file and .dts files that
include it.

I *could* define both properties in r8a7790.dtsi and then let board .dts
files override the clock rate if wanted.

I was mistaken about this; the other dividers are programmed by
clk-div6.
