Hello,

This patch set implements serial port support for the Lager reference board,
and adds early debugging support for the r8a7790 SoC.

The code is available in my git tree at

        git://linuxtv.org/pinchartl/fbdev.git clocks/ccf/serial-lager

The branch is based on a merge of renesas-devel-20131016, v3.12-rc7 and
multiarch drivers, clk-prepare, r8a7790 CCF and sh-sci OF patches I've posted
earlier today.
