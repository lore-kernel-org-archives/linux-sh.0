In that case it were two strings ("rtc-pcf8563" versus "pcf8563"). Why
should gcc care? Or is there something going on behind the scenes which
somehow depends on the contents of the string?

Thanks. I missed that one, obviously. Should I just drop that part of
the patch and resend?

By the way, together with my previous patch (Message-ID
1337869829.22505.15.camel@x61.thuisdomein , probably not yet archived on
the web) we have found all instances of this issue, haven't we?
