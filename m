Describe the PCI USB devices that are behind the PCI bridges, adding necessary
links to the USB PHY device.

Based on the original work by Ben Dooks <ben.dooks@codethink.co.uk>.

This patch is against 'renesas-devel-v3.16-rc5-20140722' tag of Simon Horman's
'renesas.git' repo plus R8A7790/Lager USB PHY support patches posted before.
The patch requires the USB PHY driver, and USB HCD generic PHY support (also
already posted) in order to work.

Changes in version 3:
- adjusted "phys" properties in the PCI OHCI/EHCI device nodes;
- resolved rejects.

Changes in version 2:
- renamed the PCI OHCI/EHCI device nodes to comply with the PCI binding;
- changed the PHY specifier in the PCI#2 node to reflect that channel #1 support
  was dropped;
- resolved rejects, refreshed the patch.
