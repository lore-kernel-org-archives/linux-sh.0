Thanks for your patch!

40?

Comparing to other devices, you have to subtract 32 from 0x5a, not
add 32?

Table 9.5 says 2 resp. 1 instead of 3 resp. 2?

However:

"The TAG and data RAM latency can be set in the reg1_tag_ram_control and
 reg1_data_ram_control registers. However, since values to be set are
 hardware-dependent, the default values should not be modified."

Perhaps we should just omit these values?
