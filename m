Thanks, and sorry for the delay.

I have queued up the following, And I will push it either in the next
half hour or some time next week - I have to jump on a plane shortly.

Guennadi, it seems that SDHI (and MMCIF) support form
armadillo800eva-reference never made it into my tree.  And I have dropped
r8a7740.dtsi changes from the patch below accordingly.  Would you care to
repost that series with the compatibility string updated?

[PATCH] ARM: shmobile: update SDHI DT compatibility string to the <unit>-<soc> format

Currently DT compatibility strings of both types can be found in the kernel
sources: <unit>-<soc> and <soc>-<unit>, whereas a unique format should be
followed and the former one is preferred. This patch converts the SDHI
MMC driver and its users to the common standard. This is safe for now, since
ATM no real products are using this driver with DT.
