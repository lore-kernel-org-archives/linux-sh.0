Hi Olof, Hi Arnd,

this pull-request is based on renesas-soc-for-v3.11 which you have
previously pulled.

This pull may cause various conflicts though I believe all of them are not
difficult to resolve. The renesas-next-20130613 tag in my tree illustrates
how I have handled the conflicts with both changes already in arm-soc and
changes I intend to send pull requests for in the near future.

The following changes since commit 413bfd0e67894c930242482cd15ac09a800e2ab8:

  ARM: shmobile: sh73a0: div4 clocks must check the kick bit before changing rate (2013-06-07 14:24:52 +0900)
