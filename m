    I'll look into that when I have time.

    I have switched to another board now (with newer U-Boot flashed),
and I was able to change the baud rate in U-Boot. However, SPL and U-Boot
still start at 38400 and now I'm having garbage instead of the version and 
hardware info. :-(

    The kernel console started working automagically for me at 115200 on the 
new board.

    Thank you, looks like there's no need now.
