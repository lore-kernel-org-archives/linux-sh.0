I tried to keep this binding similar to others, that I proposed in "mmc: 
add DT bindings for more MMC capability flags." Actually, the above is 
indeed wrong, I would call it "cap-sdio-irq." And in that patch I tried to 
keep binding names resembling as closely as possible respective MMC_CAP_* 
flags. I think, it would have been better if "enable-sdio-wakeup" and 
"keep-power-in-suspend" were also named, following the same rule, but it's 
too late now. Anyway, I'm not too concerned about the names. We can use 
"enable-sdio-irq" too if you like.

Thanks
