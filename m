Yes, all these certainly make sense. As far as I understand, we are still 
in the process of defining good clear rules for DTs, there is an "ABI" 
discussion currently running on ALKML and IIRC this is also going to be a 
topic for one of coming conferences. So, hopefully we're approaching a 
state of a greater clarity about DT.

Makes sense too, sure.

Sorry, what exactly would be a bug? Not having an exact IP version? But 
you did write above - "if that IP block has a version independent of the 
SoC that contains it." In my case it doesn't really. Those IPs only exist 
within those SoCs.

In general - yes, I fully agree. I wasn't sure about this specific case, 
exactly because those are standard properties, that, if implemented as DT 
properties, can be trivially re-used by all drivers with 0 additional 
code.

I think it is, in most cases at least.

I think it rather works the other way round. Those flags only mark 
hardware _capabilities_. But don't tell the driver to use them yet. 
Normally drivers just collect them in their .caps and .caps2 fields and 
pass on to the mmc core. The mmc core then card detection and querying and 
if a card and the host interface to it are suitable for certain features, 
marked in those capability fields, the core will then ask the host driver 
to enable it. Of course, I don't know all drivers some drivers might well 
behave differently, but even then they anyway are the first to find out 
about those capabilities. After calling mmc_of_parse() drivers get those 
capabilities back and can do whatever needs to be done to validate them, 
and can even clear them again, if they find out, that some of them aren't 
really available. mmc_of_parse() just makes driver's work a bit easier, 
but doesn't take control away from it.
