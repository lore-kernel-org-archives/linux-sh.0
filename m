You seem to be keeping the other sh7372 board currently in the mainline - 
the mackerel, so, keeping this one as well at least as long as sh7372 is 
at all supported shouldn't come at an extra cost. As for INTC DT - I 
think, the original idea was to specify the complete INTC configuration in 
DT, which looked pretty horrifying. And it shouldn't be needed, since INTC 
config is per-SoC, not per-board. What if we keep INTC configuration in 
SoC files and use aux-data to supply platform data to DT device nodes? 
Would that be difficult to implement?

Thanks
