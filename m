Well, the good side is that it "only" requires enough motivation and free time 
then :-)

I suppose the idea is that dma_issue_pending_all() is only used for memcpy 
offload, and can thus ignore channels used for slave transfers.

The code seems to be buggy though. A DMA engine that can serve both memcpy and 
slave transfers could have one channel allocated for memcpy first, then a 
second channel allocated for slave transfers. This would cause the DMA_PRIVATE 
flag to be set, which will prevent dma_issue_pending_all() from calling the 
device_issue_pending operation of the memcpy channel.

If I understand the history correctly, the reason to make DMA_PRIVATE a device 
flag is to avoid starving slaves by allocating all channels of a device for 
memcpy. If the DMA_PRIVATE flag is set by the DMA engine driver that works as 
expected. If the DMA engine can be used for both, though, there's no 
guarantee, and the behaviour won't be very predictable.

By the way, shouldn't DMA_PRIVATE be renamed to something more explicit, such 
as DMA_NO_MEMCPY or DMA_SLAVE_ONLY ?

When the channels are independent, sure, but they sometimes share hardware 
resources. For instance the Renesas R-Car Gen2 SoCs have 2 generic-purpose DMA 
engines usable for both memcpy and slave transfers, each of them having 15 
channels. Each DMA engine arbitrates memory accesses from the different 
channels, using either fixed priorities, or a round-robin arbitration. In that 
case it wouldn't make much sense to split the 15 channels across several 
dma_device instances.

I actually have the opposite problem, in my case channels of physically 
separate DMA engines can be used interchangeably to serve the system's slaves. 
Using the DMA engine DT bindings, DT nodes of the slaves currently reference a 
specific DMA engine, even if they can be served by both. This leads to limited 
dynamic channel allocation capabilities (especially when taking into account 
lazy channel allocation as mentioned in another mail in this thread).

I was also thinking about dma_async_issue_pending(). Isn't that function part 
of the DMA engine API rather than the async API ?
