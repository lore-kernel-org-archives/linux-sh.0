enums are cleaner for these cases, but you also have the case where the
enum type itself is variable size depending on the ABI being used. If
the type in question isn't being packed in to a user-visible data
structure then this will never matter, but it does help to be a bit
careful here regardless. Many people were bitten by this in the ARM
OABI -> EABI conversion, while other architectures generally managed to
get it right from the onset.
