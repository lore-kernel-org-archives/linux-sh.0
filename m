How about rephrasing/rearranging this to:

This document describes common bindings of all video pipeline devices.

General concept
---------------

Video pipelines consist of external devices, e.g. camera sensors, controlled
over an I2C, SPI or UART bus, and SoC internal IP blocks, including video DMA
engines and video data processors.
SoC internal blocks are described by DT nodes, placed similarly to other SoC
blocks. External devices are represented as child nodes of their respective
bus controller nodes, e.g. I2C.

Data interfaces on all video devices are described by "port" child DT nodes.
Configuration of a port depends on other devices participating in the data
transfer and is described by "link" DT nodes, specified as children of the
"port" nodes:

/foo {
	port@0 {
		link@0 { ... };
		link@1 { ... };
	};
	port@1 { ... };
};

If a port can be configured to work with more than one other device on the
same bus, a "link" child DT node must be provided for each of them.
If more than one port is present on a device or more than one link is
connected to a port, a common scheme, using "#address-cells" "#size-cells"
and "reg" properties is used.
