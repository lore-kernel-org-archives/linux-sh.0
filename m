I did consider doing that but it seemed like over-engineering.  However,
given what Geert said about the other SoCs it seems worth doing.

However, pinconf arguments are limited to 16 bits so I think I will have
to make the units millivolts not microvolts.

Right.

Right, this is left over from the previous version where I added an
operation to struct sh_pfc_pin.

I prefer the former.

Ben.
