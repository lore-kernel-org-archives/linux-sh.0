Er, what? Yes it does. It has this silly id to string mapping thing that
is at present duplicated between the perf and the oprofile code for no
reason. Having a generic (albeit optional) perf_pmu_name() would allow
this to be cleaned up.

This has nothing at all to do with the SH oprofile code and everything to
do with oprofile in general. This is the vary basis for the CPU model
matching in the oprofile userspace tools, it's string based by design.
Given that we're already seeing architetures double up their strings in
both places, this really wants a consensus and to be dealt with before
other architetures start getting the wrong idea.
