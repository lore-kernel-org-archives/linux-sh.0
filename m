It's partly a question of avoiding unnecessary activity.  Is there any
reason to resume a device if it's just going to be autosuspended again
a few seconds later?

It's also a matter of principle.  A system sleep should be as
transparent as possible (except for the passage of time, of course).  
When the sleep is over, devices should be in the same state as before
it began.

In the case of USB, it's not possible to resume a suspended device
without first resuming and using a host controller.  The host
controller driver will realize that the firmware has taken over the
controller and will reset the controller.

For devices that were not autosuspended, this action converts an
ordinary resume into a reset-resume.  A different driver method is
called, and drivers that don't support reset-resume are automatically
unbound from their devices (and then reprobed afterward).

For devices that were autosuspended, the controller reset will put them 
back into a suspended state.  They will remain that way until they are 
autoresumed -- and of course it will be an "auto-reset-resume".

What happens if the firmware is sufficiently sneaky that it manages to
fool the host controller driver?  In that case we end up with a device
that really is at full power even though the kernel thinks it is
autosuspended.  When we finally try to autoresume it, we will realize
that it wasn't suspended after all.

When the device or perhaps its parent hub is resumed, we will realize 
the device is gone.  An attempted autoresume will simply fail.  Until 
that happens, the kernel may believe the device is present when in fact 
it isn't.

So the work routine would somehow be aware when a system sleep is in
progress, at which point it would return immediately without doing
anything?  That seems racey.  Isn't it easier just to freeze the
workqueue?

For pending autosuspend, okay.  The device was powered up before the
system sleep, it remains powered up afterward, and another autosuspend
will occur in due course.

For pending autoresume requests coming from user I/O calls, again okay.  
There can't be any of these because userspace is frozen, and besides,
they wouldn't go through the workqueue anyway.

For autoresume requests coming from an interrupt handler, I'm not so 
sure.  I don't know of any good examples -- in fact there don't seem to 
be any examples at the moment.  (The USB core supports autoresume 
requests in interrupt context, AFAICS no driver uses them.)  So maybe 
it's premature to worry about this case.

Lastly, we have resume requests coming from a device -- i.e., remote
wakeup requests.  This is a little tricky.  Suppose you have remote
wakeup enabled, and you press a key on your USB keyboard just as the
computer is going to sleep.  Should this cause the sleep to be aborted?  
Should it cause the computer to wake back up again right away?  Should
the keystroke be ignored?

More to the point, suppose you plug in a new USB device as the computer
is going to sleep.  When the computer wakes up, shouldn't it realize
that a new device has been connected?  This is the same problem that
other people have been discussing -- what should happen to wakeup IRQs
during the time the system is suspending?  Will they get delivered 
later on (and when drivers are ready to receive them)?
