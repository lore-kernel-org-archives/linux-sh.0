I think convert DT is best way.

It looks don't use SH compatible peripherals.
I think if it's a SH compatible, it's better to maintain
the platform_device structure.
But use incompatible peripherals (So need new platform_device),
It's difficult to maintain it.

I trying SE7619 target convert to DT. It works fine.
So no problem in 0PF platform DT support.
