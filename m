Sorry about that, it seems this has been rather messy.

Unfortunately I have noticed what appear to be two merge problems.

I am not sure what the best way to resolve them is,
but my corrections are below. If you need formal patches please
don't hesitate to ask.

* The arch/arm/mach-shmobile/Makefile problem seems to break builds where
  ARCH_SHMOBILE_LEGACY or ARCH_SHMOBILE_MULTI are enabled. In particular
  the following defconfigs: multi_v7, bockw, shmobile.

* The arch/arm/boot/dts/Makefile problem just causes some unnecessary
  dtb compilation. Which seems harmless though should be cleaned
  up at some point.
