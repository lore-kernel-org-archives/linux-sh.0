Does that mean some clocks aren't wired up, or that some clocks don't
exist at all?

What is the behaviour of the unpopulated bits?

There are two entries in the example, the code seems to assume they are
particular registers, but this implies one.

Are these not part of a larger bank of registers?

How many, and what do they correspond to?

The description of this property doesn't describe half of what it means.
I believe something like the below does:

- renesas,indices: A list of clock IDs (single cells), one for each
  clock present. Each entry may correspond to a clock-output-names entry
  at the same index, and its location in the list defines the
  corresponding clock-specifier for the entry.

I'd imagine we have a few sparse clocks by now, and we might be able to
make this more uniform. But I may be mistaken.

Any particular reason for 1000 times? Is there a known minimum time to
switch a clock between disabled and enabled? A comment would be nice.

Cheers,
Mark.
