Yep, same here and I agree.

Sure, but the field is there for convenience.

That's possible, and maybe it makes sense. It didn't when I originally
wrote the code - quite some time ago - abstracting the LCDs into
channels and passing around a single pointer just seemed more natural
to me.

I'll have a second look at the code though. Maybe it makes sense to
shuffle things around a bit.

Excellent. Thanks for your review!
