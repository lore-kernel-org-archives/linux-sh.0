The reason is that
1) The hook is called from sd_ctrl_write16 which takes 
   struct tmio_mmc_host * as its first argument and;
2) The hook that has been implemented calls sd_ctrl_read16() which takes a
   struct tmio_mmc_host * as its first argument.
So it seemed logical to pass that down.

In the caes of 1) we can get the struct platform_device * using host->pdev.
However, in the case of 2) is it less clear to me how we can get the
struct tmio_mmc_host * from a struct platform_device *.
