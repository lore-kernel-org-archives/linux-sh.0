To the driver or to the '90 DTS?

If the DTS says

    compatible = "renesas,pci-r8a7790", "renesas,pci-rcar-gen2"

then the driver can just live with "renesas,pci-rcar-gen2" for now.

And later we can add

    compatible = "renesas,pci-r8a7791", "renesas,pci-rcar-gen2"

to the '91 DTS if it turns out to be compatible.

If the '91 turns out to be incompatible, or partially compatible, the driver
can be updated later to handle both "renesas,pci-r8a7790" and
"renesas,pci-r8a7791" and differentiate between them.

(That's what I was instructed to do with SPI ;-)
