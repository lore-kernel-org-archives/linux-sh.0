Ahh... OK, I understand.

Hmm...
I guesss We can use [1/3] and [2/3] patches for all Renesas SoC as generic driver,
but, all SoC needs clk/shmobile/clk-xxxx.c like [3/3].
Because it has SoC special divider values.
Is this correct ?

Now, your [1/3] patch (= for MSTP) added renesas special property
as "renesas,clock-indices".
Is it impossible to add renesas special property like "renesas,clock-custom-divider"
which can specify custom divider values in generic cpg driver ?
If we can have it, all Renesas SoC can use generic driver ?

Best regards
