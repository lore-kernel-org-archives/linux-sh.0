So, if I understand this correctly, the partitions format was added for v4.4,
then this non-backwards compatible change was added in -rc6. But, there were
also DT files that had the new-for-v4.4 partitions nodes in them that then
stopped working in -rc6?

That sounds like a regression, so this should be picked up as fixes for v4.4.

Please confirm that I've understood the setup correctly, and I'll apply the
series directly to fixes.
