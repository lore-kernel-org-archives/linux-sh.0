Either that or we say no one cares enough, and it known broken so let's
just revert the fool thing.

I honestly can't see how to support panic notifiers, before kexec.
There is no way to tell what is being done and all of the pieces
including smp_send_stop are known to be buggy.

It isn't like this latest set of patches was reviewed/tested much
better, as the first patch was wrong.
