I believe that I claimed to have tested this in the past but that
my testing was by booting a config to userspace that as it happens
did not require to timer to get that far.

I now believe there is a minor error: the interrupt number should be
(139 - 32 =) 107 rather than 139.

This allows a system with this and the related genmai patch applied
on top of renesas-next-v3.16-rc3-20140715 to boot to uerspace
when compiled with shmobile_defconfig (+ an initrd).
Without the irq number change the boot gets stuck in
ip_auto_config (which presumably sleeps).

Laurent, should I squash the following in and queue-up the result?
