Indeed. Nice catch.

I believe it was written this way to avoid integer overflow.
As soon as we get a 2.2 GHz A15 (mult = 2), "max_cpu_core_hz * mult"
will overflow.

When using Hz instead of MHz, we probably want to switch from
multiplying a small number (in MHz) to dividing a large number (in Hz):

        preset_lpj = max_cpu_core_hz / value;

So value should be:

        value = HZ * div / mult;

which is OK as mult is really small (1 or 2).
Does this look right? Haven't had my coffee yet ;-)

All of this will still overflow when clock-frequency no longer fits in u32,
and we have to revise the bindings ;-)

While this works (for now --- no longer with my proposed modifications
above), didn't you intend this?

    shmobile_setup_delay_hz(max_cpu_core_mhz * 1000000, mult, div);
