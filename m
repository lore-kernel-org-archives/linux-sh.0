Hello Lorenzo,

thanks for the review.

Now this looks super straight forward. I wonder how I came up with
inverted order (even if works in the UP case). Probably when you look
at others code and they put a v7_flush_dcache_all before the disable,
one (meaning me...) starts to bend the underlying ideas about the
caches until it fits to the code you see.

Anyway: Of course I'll take the code sequence then that works for the
UP and SMP cases.

I unfortunately don't know about the hardware design of this SoC.

I haven't experienced this when using suspend-to-ram but only for
CPUIdle. Of course this might be just a matter of probability though.

Ok that sounds good. As we don't touch the hotpath I don't care much
about some extra cycles and I appreciate moving towards
standardization. I'll try that out and send a v3 with the two changes.

So thanks a lot,

 Bastian
