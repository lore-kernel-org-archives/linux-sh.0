For some reason I assumed this would go through a different subsystem tree.
I'm fine with taking it through my tree, if you think that is best.

I am a bit worried about handling conflicts that may arise, especially from
the first two patches in that series which re-arrange things
alphabetically. But I see that the files in question are not updated very
often, so I suppose we should be safe enough.


For now I have tentatively queued up both this patchset and the
dependency listed immediately above. Please take a look
at the sh73a0-multiplatform-for-v3.20 and drivers-for-v3.20 branches
and the renesas-next-20150114-v3.19-rc1 tag to see if I missed something.
