I had not noticed, but yes that does seem to be the case.

Ok, that makes sense. But in that the labels want updating, right?

Excellent. I think we can easily change that for the r8a7794 as the
nodes aren't being consumed nor have been part of a release. But I'm
less sure about a path forward for the r8a7791. What are your thoughts?
