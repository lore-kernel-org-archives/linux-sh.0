I couldn't understand about last 2 lines.
Do you mean I need to add these method in CPG ?
But, this calculates best clock of parent clock (= from CPG) and divider (= on MMC)
Why CPG need to care about MMC's divider,
and how to set it from CPG ??

It needs not only max/min range, but also divider's limit.
I don't know how to do it. but...

 1) add admissible max/min range on CPG node
    add admissible divider range on MMC node
     -> Does this max/min range really from CPG ?
        but, we can reuse this on other DIV6

 2) add admissible max/min range on MMC node
    add admissible divider range on MMC node
     -> reasonable, but we can't reuse it on other DIV6
        what is difference between 2) and 3) ?

 3) add admissible max/min range on MMC driver
    add admissible divider range on MMC driver
     -> This is the reason why we have SoC specific compatible name ?
        These limit came from SoC.

In my opinion, I can accept 1) or 3).

Best regards
