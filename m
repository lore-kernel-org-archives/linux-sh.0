Hi Guennadi,

Thanks for your work on this. I may be reading the code wrong, or
perhaps my stack of patches is not the same as yours, but I can't see
any code dealing with hotplug for SDHI2? It looks to me that your
patch is updating the comment about PORT162 and IRQ0 but does nothing
about it on the software side. I sort of assume that we want to have
hotplug support via IRQ on all SDHI channels if possible. But maybe
that's not possible?

Cheers,
