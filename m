Thanks for your patches. I think they look good in general, but patch
[2/5] needs to be reworked to exclude the r8a7790 compatible string.
Patch [3/5] probably depends on [2/5] so it needs to wait too.

[1/5] looks fine

[2/5] needs rework
[3/5] depends on [2/5] - needs to wait

[4/5] looks good
[5/5] looks good

For the patches [1/5], [4/5], [5/5]

Let us discuss [2/5] in a separate thread.

Thanks for your help!
