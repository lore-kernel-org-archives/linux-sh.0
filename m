Thanks for your comments. I agree with you and I've changed the name
in V2 that I just posted.

Good question. It seems that other drivers use the DT "ctsrts"
property to flag just this, and maybe it makes sense to simply use
such a property in the board DTS file to opt-in on modem control on a
board-basis.

Something similar is included in my prototype hack that I just posted:
[PATCH] sh73a0 KZM9G CTS/RTS prototype

Thanks for your help!
