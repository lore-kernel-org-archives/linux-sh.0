Right, so in other words this problem must be solved by the caller of
clk_get, as it should be. I have never much looked at the pm clk code in
question, but I gave it a quick look and came up with some example code
that does not compile, in an effort to be as helpful as possible.

Basically I added a flex array to struct pm_clk_notifier_block, so that
now there are two flex arrays which is stupid. But I am too lazy to
replace the nbclk->clks thing with a malloc after walking all of the
clk_id's to figure out the number of clocks. Or we could just add
.num_clk to the struct, fix up all 4 users of it and drop the NULL
sentinel used the .clk_id's... Hmm that would have been better.

Anyways here is the ugly, non-compiling code. I'll take another look at
it in one year if no one else beats me to it.

Regards,
Mike
