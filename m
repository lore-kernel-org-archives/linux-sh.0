Subject: [PATCH v3] ARM: shmobile: BOCK-W: add Ether support

Register Ether device from bockw_init(), passing the platform data to it, adding
only the RMII pin group to bockw_pinctrl_map[].  Although the LINK signal exists
on the board, it's connected to the link/activity LED  output of the PHY, thus
the link disappears and reappears after each packet. We'd be better off ignoring
such signal and getting the link state from the PHY indirectly.

The patch is atop of Simon's 'renesas.git' repo, 'renesas-next-20130528' tag
and the USB patches just reposted. I decided to move it ahead of the VIN patches
as it can be merged right now since all dependecies have been already met.

Changes from version 2:
- resolved rejects due to patch move;
- removed the code dealing with the pin conflict with VIN1 and the note related
  to it from the changelog.

Changes from the original posting:
- refreshed the patch.
