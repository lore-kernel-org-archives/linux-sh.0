Hi Olof, Hi Kevin, Hi Arnd,

Please consider these second round of Renesas ARM based SoC DT updates for v4.2.

This pull request is based on the previous round of
such requests, tagged as renesas-dt-for-v4.2,
which I have already sent a pull-request for.

The change from using "nor-jedec" instead of "jedec,spi-nor" should
be safe as the usage of "nor-jedec" was added earlier in the v4.2 release
cycle and thus has not been present in a release.


The following changes since commit 7706993e2deb75022dbcfc3043890aa1a0020189:

  ARM: shmobile: r8a7791: Enable DMA for HSUSB (2015-05-12 08:55:16 +0900)
