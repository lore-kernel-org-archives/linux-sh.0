Yes, the callbacks are exactly for this purpose.

Yes, they do.

It should be up to the bus type.  In theory.

In fact we assume that the hierarchy is reflected by the ordering of dpm_list
(ie. "parent" devices should be put on the list before the "child" ones and
therefore they should be suspened later and resumed earlier).  This works
in the majority of cases, because bus controllers are usually registered
before the devices on the bus.  Still, there are other dependencies between
devices that we don't have any means to take into account at the moment.

I really think so.

I'm not really comfortable with this approach, because it adds the constraint
that the 'system sleep' callbacks should _also_ be suitable for run-time PM.
That need not be the case in principle.

I'd vote in favor of adding new callbacks.  If they happen to point to the same
code as the other dev_pm_ops callbacks in all cases, we can just drop them
later.  That should be easier than adding new callbacks when it appears they
are actually necessary at one point in future.

Best,
Rafael
