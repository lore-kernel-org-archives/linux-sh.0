I think it should be enough to change the dependency from !ARCH_MULTIPLATFORM
to !SMP_ON_UP as a start, and drop the reverse dependency in SMP_ON_UP.

Try running 'make randconfig' a few hundred times (without building the kernel)
and see if any obvious Kconfig warnings come up after doing that.

There are two different scenarios to consider here:

a) building a kernel for a single machine while CONFIG_ARCH_MULTIPLATFORM is
   enabled
b) actually enabling all sorts of machines

I have patches to make ARCH_MULTIPLATFORM always enabled on all ARMv6/v7
targets and would like to get them into the next kernel. The main reasons
for this are to get rid of the special cases for non-multiplatform targets,
and to allow 'make allmodconfig' to include all known v6/v7 targets. This
means that I would definitely want to see XIP_KERNEL being possible on your
machine with a), but I agree that there is not much use for b) here.

Don't worry about that. We definitely rely on XIP_KERNEL for some of the
NOMMU targets, and it's not going away.
