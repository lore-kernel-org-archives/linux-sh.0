This is admittedly a confusing process. I have to parse each defconfig
to figure out what the mach-* is, then read MAINTAINERS. Perhaps you can
update your MAINTAINERS entries? This is a wide problem, that makes
patch submission for defconfigs even more difficult.

Olof, other ARM SOC maintainers,

What do you recommend? Should I send another couple of patches just to
split this trivial patch? Olof mentioned taking some patch(es) directly,
and handling merge conflicts when they come.

That seems like you're just avoiding touching defconfig for the sake of
not touching defconfig. Additionally, this method only really makes
sense for an upgrade path (otherwise, how would you configure MTD_M25P80
&& !MTD_SPI_NOR?). Is this approach consistent across other mach-*?

Yes. That's what "depends on" means.

BTW, M25P80 will likely be moved under the SPI-NOR submenu eventually
(its driver is not really a "Standalone MTD" anymore), but currently
this is just a "depends on".

I do not understand this paragraph. How does M25P80 select M25P80?

Feel free to submit your own patch if you don't want mine.

Seriously? It's mentioned in the commit description, and it's really
really trivial.
