Thanks for describing these.

Is there any particular reason why SMP startup needs to happen earlier
than ioremap() is available?

From a hardware point of view on Cortex-A9 the SCU needs to be enabled
and the number of available cores need to be determined. The SCU
enabling can probably happen later and the number of cores are already
limited to the kernel configuration maximum number of cores setting,
so it should be possible to use that to size any early per-cpu
variables if needed. So I wonder why we're not enabling SMP later than
we actually do? Using maxcpus=1 and late CPU hotplug from user space
is certainly working fine.

Regarding early printk, you are correct that we're not using that ARM
specific debug output. Instead we are relying on earlyprintk via early
platform devices. This way we are not only multi-soc and multi-subarch
already, we are also multi-arch. For really early console output we
rely on the clocks and pin function being initialized by the boot
loader and we also require 1:1 entity mappings so we can use printouts
before ioremap() is functional. So yes, we like using 1:1 virt-phys
memory maps for early printouts.

We do not use early printk with DT at this point. If we would be able
to move the SMP init later then perhaps we could debug SMP issues with
serial ports described by DT in the future?

Sure.

Ok. As you probably can tell by now - I would like to get rid of the
SMP case if possible.

The 1:1 mapping is deliberately chosen to be simple. So in the case
when people do register I/O without ioremap() then at least we can
look up the address in the data sheet. I've seen too many examples of
people not using ioremap and instead inventing their own magic mapping
table with undocumented hard coded address that map to something even
more unknown. Of course we should be aiming at using ioremap(). If we
for some reason can't then we should use 1:1 mappings.

While I agree to move more towards using ioremap(), I can't really see
how this affects our multiplatform situation. Our device drivers have
always been using the driver model and we do never export any virtual
addresses in any header files. If you have any particular area that
you think needs work related to ioremap() then perhaps we can get
together on next conference and talk it through?

As I mentioned before, from my point of view the main limiting factor
for mach-shmobile multiplatform at this point is the clock framework.
The SH clock framework does already support ioremap() though, so it is
just a matter of making the clock code actually use it. And while
we're doing that we may as well solve the multiplatform issue to and
move towards common clocks.

Thanks,
