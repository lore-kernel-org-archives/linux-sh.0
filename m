[adding Ben Dooks, since he was complaining about this as well]

My feeling is that we should adjust the strategy for shmobile. We've
had good success with the dual strategy of keeping board support
separate for DT-enabled and ATAGS-only boards in the sense that
we did not have to coordinate updates for bindings between subsystem
and architecture git trees, which has always been source for
problems on other platforms.

However, the price for this seems to be that it's still not possible
to get a properly working system without a board file, and my feeling
is that it's taking too long to get there. In particular, we now see
new drivers getting added (I noticed VIN, which Ben mentioned before)
that start out with just platform_device support but no DT support.
This is bad, because it means DT users are always behind.

Ok, thanks for the list.

I think you should try to close the gap between ATAGS and DT now and
stop the dual strategy. You seem to have come far enough with the
basic infrastructure (clock, pinctrl, irq, timer, ...) that all the
devices missing DT support now are on-chip peripherals. If this is the
case, it should be possible to use auxdata registration in the
per-soc files to connect the platform data to the remaining devices
that are lacking DT bindings. This means we have to be more careful
with the dependencies when a driver gains a DT binding, but at least
we can enforce that any driver in the future only gets merged with
a proper DT binding as we do for other subarchitectures, and you don't
have to implement probing twice for each new driver.
