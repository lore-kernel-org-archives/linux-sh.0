Hi Olof, Hi Kevin, Hi Arnd,

Please consider these Renesas ARM based SoC boards cleanups for v3.17.


This pull request is based on
"Renesas ARM Based SoC DT Timers Updates for v3.17",
tagged as renesas-dt-timers-for-v3.17,
which I have sent a pull request for.

In this pull-request cleanups are added on top of new development
due to the order in which the code was developed. In general
we prefer the reverse ordering.


v2 of this pull request is a rebase of v1 removing
a merge of defconfig changes at the base of the pull-request.
The motivation for that was to avoid attempts to use
genmai_defconfig after the board code it relies on has been removed.
Olof indicated he would prefer not to add that dependency.


The following changes since commit 9394af4314554d15762585a3464cefaa2e6d0420:

  ARM: shmobile: genmai-reference: Enable MTU2 in device tree (2014-07-15 21:26:42 +0900)
