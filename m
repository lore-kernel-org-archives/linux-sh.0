Hmmm... Yes that would mean use the 196 sized kmalloc array which is not a
power of two slab. But the code looks fine to me.

The commit allows off slab management for PAGE_SIZE >> 5 that is 128.

After that commit kmem_cache_create would try to allocate an off slab
management structure which is not available during early boot.
But the slab_early_init is set which should prevent the use of an off slab
management infrastructure in kmem_cache_create().

However, the failure in line 2283 shows that the OFF SLAB flag was
mistakenly set anyways!!!! Something must havee cleared slab_early_init?
