[Adding Uwe and Maxime to Cc]

I believe Uwe has been running XIP_KERNEL on efm32 for a while now,
but he also mentioned that he needed some extra hacks in the linker
script and elsewhere to get it to work.

It would be good to coordinate this, he may have found additional
problems, or he can maybe help test the new approach on his hardware.
