I'm told that I forgot to add the Acks from the previous v6 to this version:

Acked-by: Jean Pihet <j-pihet@ti.com> (v6)
Tested-by: Jean Pihet <j-pihet@ti.com> (v6, omap3)
Tested-by: Amit Daniel <amit.kachhap@linaro.org> (v6, Exynos4)
For the generic cpuidle changes:
Reviewed-by: Deepthi Dharwar <deepthi@linux.vnet.ibm.com>

If anyone sees other omissions or has any suggested changes or
improvements in my patch submissions semantics, please let me know.

Thanks,
Rob
