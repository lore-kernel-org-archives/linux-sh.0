This patchset enables the EthernetAVB on the Salvator-X board.
With it and its dependencies in place I have have successfully
booted to an nfsroot user-space (arm64 Debian Jessie).

In order to achieve that I used the following command line set from u-boot.


As per "[PATCH v11 0/8] arm64: renesas: Add Renesas R8A7795 SoC support":

	This series has undergone a number of rounds of development and
	review on the linux-sh mailing list. This is the first posting to a
	wider audience from which we are now seeking review.

	It is anticipated that the CPG bindings used this patchset will be
	changed before they hit mainline and thus this patchset will need
	to be updated accordingly. Reviewers are advised to skip over that
	portion of this patchset unless they have a particular interest in
	that discussion.
