that isnt terribly clear.  it might be for you, but for the people attempting 
to coordinate source code, it really isnt.

using git, you can format patches and number them and include a cover letter.  
that would make everything clear for people.
git format-patch -n --cover-letter HEAD~3

then you'd end up with 4 clearly marked files (assuming your log message for 
each change is clear).  in the summary, you should then make statements like:
Patch 1 (... subject ...) in this series can be applied by itself for the bus 
driver.  Then patch 2 (... subject ...) and 3 (... subject ...) can be applied 
as they need the bus changes.
