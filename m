Sigh, the always oh so polite Russell.  I have read the thread before; I 
reread the whole thread one more time before posting.

Going that way might very well mean that you will be stuck with two 
implementations forever.  But yes, it might be better with two working 
ones than one which takes a bit longer to finish.

But my impression is that the different suggestions in the thread aren't 
that far apart.  Except for the discussion if clk_enable/disable should 
be able to sleep or not, people seem to agree on most of the rest of the 
API.
