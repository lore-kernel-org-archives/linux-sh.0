Sure, I think it is possible.

I would prefer if they were separated out so that I can apply
them to separate branches, in keeping with arm-soc requirements.

The branches can depend on each other which is how any dependencies
can be handled.

At this point I am thinking of merging the soc branch, with this
series added, into the pinmux branch and then applying the r8a73a4 pfc
patches to the result.

I think I will take it into my tree as this series relies on it.
