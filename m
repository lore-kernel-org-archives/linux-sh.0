Well, actually this platform driver is used together with already
existing drivers, so there are no new virtio drivers to wait for.

The drivers that have been tested are so far:

CONFIG_VIRTIO_CONSOLE=y
CONFIG_VIRTIO_NET=y

At this point there are four different pieces of code working together

1) Virtio platform driver patches (for guest)
2) SH4AL-DSP guest kernel patch
3) ARM UIO driver patches (for host)
4) User space backing code for ARM based on lguest.c

These patches in this mail thread are 1), and I decided to brush up
that portion and submit upstream because it's the part that is easiest
to break out. I intend to post the rest bit by bit over time, but if
someone is interested then I can post everything at once too.

The lguest device code is very similar as well, perhaps it's worth
refactoring that a bit to build on top of the platform driver. Not
sure if you see that as a move in the right direction though.

Thanks for your feedback!
