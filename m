You are correct that Emma Mobile EV2 only supports regular zImage boot
(1 above) in upstream. It is quite possible that the hardware in
theory could boot in other ways (this depends on the Mask ROM
capability), but I have not heard about anyone trying anything else.

As for chips coming from "Renesas Electronics", "Renesas Technology"
and if I may add "Renesas Mobile", the relationships between the
companies are quite complex so I'm afraid I can't give any good
answer.

The MMCIF/SDHI boot code was initially written for some older SH based
SoCs, but was re-implemented for ARM and sh7372 at some point. To boot
Linux directly from the reset vector it is necessary with memory
controller setup, and this is only supported by a few boards. At this
point AP4EVB and Mackerel have enough upstream coverage to boot
directly from NOR flash, MMCIF, SDHI or over USB gadget.

As for actual SoC support - which that support what boot methods much
depends on the product line and what has been implemented in the Mask
ROM. The boot mode is usually selected with a couple of pins at boot
time. Those pins are usually tied to DIP switches on the different
boards. On more recent SoCs I believe the Mask ROM allows for boot
over a wide range of I/O devices, but lately I have not seen anyone
booting Linux directly from the reset vector.

Regarding USB gadget boot and the "r_usb_boot" tool, it is known to
work on sh7372 and sh73a0.

Hope this helps,
