I just came across this patch after it was merged (with no review from
any device tree maintainer :()

These are bad names for describing hardware properties. There is no
reason to carry over the "cap" prefix from the internal usage of the
hardware characteristics in the kernel.

Other drivers use, for example "supports-highspeed", which this
duplicates to some extent. More work should have been done to
commonalize them. Etc.
