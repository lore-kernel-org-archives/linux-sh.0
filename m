Nope, that branch is already part of linux-next, and linux-next still
fails to compile for 20+ defconfigs[1]

It's definitely not linker script related.

Using "arm-linux-gnueabi-gcc (Ubuntu/Linaro 4.7.3-12ubuntu1) 4.7.3",
here's the error when building for multi_v7_defconfig (full log
available[2]):

../mm/migrate.c: In function 'migrate_pages':
../mm/migrate.c:1148:1: internal compiler error: in push_minipool_fix, at config/arm/arm.c:13101
Please submit a full bug report,
with preprocessed source if appropriate.
See <file:///usr/share/doc/gcc-4.7/README.Bugs> for instructions.
Preprocessed source stored into /tmp/ccO1Nz1m.out file, please attach
this to your bugreport.
make[2]: *** [mm/migrate.o] Error 1
make[2]: Target `__build' not remade because of errors.
make[1]: *** [mm] Error 2

build bisect points to commit 21f992084aeb[3], but that doesn't revert
cleanly so I haven't got any further than that yet.

    page-flags: define behavior of FS/IO-related flags on compound pages

    It seems we don't have compound page on FS/IO path currently.  Use
    NO_COMPOUND to catch if we have.

    The odd exception is PG_dirty: sound uses compound pages and maps
    them
    with PTEs.  NO_COMPOUND triggers VM_BUG_ON() in set_page_dirty() on
    handling shared fault.  Let's use HEAD for PG_dirty.
