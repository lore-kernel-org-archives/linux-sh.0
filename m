I did receive review comments on v1, which I implemented in v2.
Simon applied v3.

Please note that this is not a driver for the common "simple-bus", but an
extension for buses that rely on clocks and/or PM domains.
The "simple-bus" base bindings were taken from ePAPR.

Anyway, I'm collecting some Ack's...

Thanks!
