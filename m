Hi Arnd,

Thanks for the review.

Ok, I understand what you mean, though the rcar_pcie_phy_init_rcar_h1 
function is an extra call for r8a7779 devices to setup the PHY, not an 
alternative to rcar_pcie_hw_init.

Hmm, I don't like the idea of depending on settings made by a bootloader, 
when it may be that a different bootloader could be used, or no bootloader 
at all.

The I/O window can be anywhere I believe, so I guess I should pull the 
actual bus address from the DT.
All existing devices I have seen, have a single PCIe host.

Ok, will do.

The PHYs are separate entities, but access to them is via the PCIe 
controller's registers. In the general case, there shouldn't be any PHY 
setup to do, it's just the R-Car H1 devices that needs a little tweaking.

Based on the restrictions of these registers, it seemed like a sensible 
approach to open up the whole 32-bit address space. I'll have a look at 
the x-gene patches to see if that would be better.

I had intended to send a patch later on to open this up to the first 12GB. 
Limitations of this block of hardware mean that we can do at most three 
4GB regions. The first 12GB would be ok for LPAE on existing devices as 
all DDR is mapped within that range, but obviously not ideal.

Good catch, copied from another PCIe driver!
