that's putting it mildly....

Personally, I would be happy with no more platform support at-all.

Agreed, for development purposes my current development tree I
am using on the Lager is showing:

  136 files changed, 13142 insertions(+), 1765 deletions(-)

This includes a specific lager_defconfig and Simon's development
work at the time 3.14-rc3 was out.

I've tested Ether, I2C, SHDI and MMCIF.

The ALSA is on list and seems to be working with minor patches for
the odd issue we found when testing. I will re-post the DMAC branch
tonight for people to review.

VIN, I've sent patches for but these need to be re-sent with some
updates for soc-camera as well as the video input driver updates.

The USB is currently work in progress, both Sergei and I have sent
patches for the PHY, I have patches for DT for the USB host on list.

I feel this would have been faster if we had not found multiple issues
such as the pm_runtime, and bugs in some of the dt support that seems
to have missed being tested until the above have been attempted.

I hope between Geert, Laurent, Sergei and the people at Renesas we've
made some significant steps forward this release cycle. The issues
with pm_runtime should now be sorted as well as other device-tree
problems with shmobile.
