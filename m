* Correct base address of SD3 div6 clk.
* Update div6 clock node labels
  There appears to have been some inconsistency and confusion here as on
  the r8a7790 these clocks are referred to as SD(HI)1 and SD(HI)2 while on
  the r8a7791 and r8a7794 they are referred to as SD(HI)2 and SD(HI)3.

This has no run-time affect as the clock nodes are not currently used.

* A similar change to update the div6 clock node names and labels
  appears to be required for the r8a7791.  The base addresses appear to be
  correct there.

* This patch is a revised version of " ARM: shmobile: r8a7794: Correct SDHI
  base address, clock labels and output-names"
