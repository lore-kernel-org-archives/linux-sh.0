One (quite hackish) possible way around this is to register the platform 
driver (using a static variable to ensure the driver isn't registered multiple 
times) in the IRQCHIP_DECLARE'd init function, and then call 
of_platform_device_create() to create the platform device. This should get the 
device probed immediately.
