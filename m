I think this makes sense and you we shouldn't force you as the platform
maintainer to do it the other way. Incrementally removing the auxdata
and platform_data structures as most platforms do is nice in the sense
that it allows you to have a fully working system booting with DT
from the start and to reduce the amount of code as early as possible,
and for instance this has worked rather well on kirkwood/orion/dove/mvebu.

The price for that method is that you end up having to coordinate patches
carefully between subsystems so you first add DT support to a driver,
and then atomically change the dts file and the board file to the
method. With your way, you can avoid a lot of the trouble we've seen
on other platforms with complex dependency graphs or broken
bisection.

My preference would be if you can get CONFIG_MULTIPLATFORM to work on
as many of your SoCs as possible, but that depends on having at least
some support for COMMON_CLK.
