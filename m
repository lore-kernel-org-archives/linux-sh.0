Regarding documentation, as much as I'd like to see this, in practice
it feels highly unlikely since I'm not in control of the actual data
sheet distribution policy. I believe Emma Mobile series data sheet are
available for public download, but the rest of the SoCs are not
unfortunately.

This issue with closed documentation is not specific to r8a7740
though, so earlier developed CCF implementations included in upstream
like r8a7790, r8a7791, r7s72100 and r8a7779 are in the same state as
r8a7740.

Thanks,
