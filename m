I also think its good to remove this code. Note sure though if IA64
may still have a need of it. But then its not clear that the IA64 arch is
still in use. Is it still maintained?

Well yes many have thought so and made attempts to improve the situation
which generally have failed. But even the fast path of the page allocator
seems to bloat more and more. The situation is deteriorating instead of
getting better and as a result lots of subsystems create their own caches
to avoid the page allocator.
