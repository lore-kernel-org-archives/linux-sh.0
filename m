My observation was mostly based on the fact that while there are a
number of tunables in the platform data, there seems to mostly be a
few different main collections of settings used. I.e. several of them
seem to share several of the tunables.

Maybe that's mostly coincidental, or maybe it's an indication that
most "similar-timeframe" SoCs used similar settings -- I don't know
enough to tell. Which is why I brought it up.
