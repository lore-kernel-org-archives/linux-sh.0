In

https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/2640061/

I proposed a simple immediate fix for this problem. Arnd at the same time 
developed an alternative solution:

https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/2644121/
https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/2644111/

Which, I think, is a much larger change and isn't suitable as a bug-fix 
this late in the release cycle. Instead those patches address other issues 
with the shdma drivers, which might need to be carefully studied and 
solutions have to be found, which, however, would require more work and 
need a longer time. What is your opinion on this? Would you agree to apply 
v2 of this patch, as referenced above or would you prefer a different 
solution?

Thanks
Guennadi
