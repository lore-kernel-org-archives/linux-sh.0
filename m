I personally think it is neat to use as few callbacks as possible in
the DT_MACHINE. Hooking in SMP ops in ->init_early() means that the
boards now are unaware if SMP is used or not - and it makes sense to
me to write board code that is independent of SMP.

Anyway, I suspect that Olof prefers to use smp_ops() instead, so I
think these patches just should be dropped.

Cheers,
