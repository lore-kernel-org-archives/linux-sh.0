There was also this nasty DMA issue Guennadi fixed recently...

Ok, do you still have that AR6002 and could test with that by any chance?

I'm pretty sure its using 4-bit mode, from the probe of the card:

mmc1: clock 0Hz busmode 1 powermode 1 cs 0 Vdd 21 width 0 timing 0
mmc1: clock 400000Hz busmode 1 powermode 2 cs 0 Vdd 21 width 0 timing 0
mmc1: clock 400000Hz busmode 1 powermode 2 cs 1 Vdd 21 width 0 timing 0
mmc1: clock 400000Hz busmode 1 powermode 2 cs 0 Vdd 21 width 0 timing 0
mmc1: clock 400000Hz busmode 1 powermode 2 cs 0 Vdd 21 width 0 timing 0
mmc1: clock 400000Hz busmode 2 powermode 2 cs 0 Vdd 21 width 0 timing 0
mmc1: clock 25000000Hz busmode 2 powermode 2 cs 0 Vdd 21 width 0 timing 0
mmc1: clock 25000000Hz busmode 2 powermode 2 cs 0 Vdd 21 width 2 timing 0

Its doing probably not doing any multi-block data transfers, but I'll
recheck. Actually most data transfers are very small.

Yes I read this too, but this is of course only interface
between host and card, so we may be just lucky that the controller
hides these details from us.

Yeah, that would be really cool.

Thanks,
