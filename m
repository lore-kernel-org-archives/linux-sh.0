Sorry for letting this slip. How about the following in the relevant changelogs:

	By documenting this compat sting it may be used in DTSs shipped,
	for example as part of ROMs. It must be used in conjunction with
	the Gen2 fallback compat string. At this time there are no known
	differences between the r8a7793 IP block and that implemented by
	the driver for the Gen2 fallback compat string. Thus there is no
	need to update the driver as the use of the Gen2 fallback compat
	string will activate the correct code in the current driver while
	leaving the option for r8a7793-specific driver code to be activated
	in an updated driver should the need arise.
