Hi Linus,

Here are two patches that I would like to get merged in v3.13 if possible. 
They first one adds CAN pin groups for the r8a7778 SoC, while the second one 
adds support for the r8a7791 SoC to the sh-pfc driver. Despite the large size 
of the diffstat there's nothing special to mention here.

The following changes since commit c6ce2b6bffe5740d572fdc5b5e690d5261abee51:

  gpio: add TB10x GPIO driver (2013-10-25 23:42:34 +0200)
