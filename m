We came across a similar request from our manufacturing folks. They have a
memory stress tool that needs to test how much bandwidth is possible between
various cpus and memory modules. Essentially they want the tool to run on some
chosen CPU and want it to drive traffic to some chosen memory module.

/dev/mem would be handy for such test programs ..
