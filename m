Thanks.

Is this considered to be best practice?
If so I am of a mind to update the patch.

Sure, I'm happy to consider that (I slightly prefer per-board patches) if:

* That is now considered best practice and;
* Due consideration is given to backwards compatibility
  (I suspect it is new DTs work with old kernels so its a non-issue)
