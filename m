That seems complicated.  You end up with lots of extra clocks (meaning
more boilerplate in the platform files) that have no meaning in the
system (what is the clock between the mux and the divider in Tegra's
i2c1 clock, it can never feed any devices), and you have to figure out
at the framework level when to propagate and when to error out.  I'm
not even sure you can always find the right place to stop propagating
- do you just keep going up until the set_parent callback succeeds, or
exists, or what?

I think you can still factor out all the common code if you treat each
clock as a possible mux, divider, and gate combination.  Each part of
the clock is still just as abstractable as before - you can set the
rate_ops to be the generic single register divider implementation, and
the gate ops to be the generic single bit enable implementation.  The
idea of what a clock node is matches the HW design, and op propagation
is easy - if it has rate ops, you can call clk_set_rate on it,
otherwise you can't.
