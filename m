I agree with Wolfram. For developers it can be important to know their own 
development process, that's true. But for upstream it is an absolute 
preference to avoid breakages. So, we should never commit patches, that 
are known to contain problems. In this case it means, that patches 2 and 3 
should be merged. It is good, that the problem has been detected and fixed 
during development or testing, this gives us a chance to avoid breaking 
the mainline, which we should certainly use.

Thanks
