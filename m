Is it possible to split this into two patches.

A board patch (that touches board-armadillo800eva.c)
and an SoC patch (the rest). Likewise for any remaining
patches in this series that touch both board and SoC code.

The reason for this is that it would make the patches fit
the branch scheme that arm-soc people like. In particular splitting
patches between soc and boards branches.

Please note that I have queued up four of the SoC earlier patches in the 
series. You don't need to repost them.
