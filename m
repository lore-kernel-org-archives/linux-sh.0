I am not a lawyer and I simply afraid errors in the legal statements.
I just pointed a mistake here.

It is not that big problem so if it is required to simplify the driver it is fine.
It seems it is  access to only the lcdc_priv->base field is needed
from the channel structure. Just take a second look at it if it can be done
differently without adding to much complexity to the driver.

I don't know the SuperH compiler but I saw things like not inlined functions
like this on PC (checked by disassembling the module object):

static void t_outb(struct tridentfb_par *p, u8 val, u16 reg)
{
        fb_writeb(val, p->io_virt + reg);
}

I didn't know why, so safer was just to mark it inline then 
the function was inlined. That was x86 gcc 3.4.6 compiler.
Before the check I believed that compiler did the right thing all the time.
You can check the objdump of the compiled module.

No, it is not critical. It is improvement.

The driver code is very clean. All above are just hints for possible 
improvements.
