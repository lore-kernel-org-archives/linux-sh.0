Postpone calling virt_to_page() translation on memory locations not
guaranteed to be backed by a struct page. Try first to map memory from
device's coherent memory pool, then perform translation if that fails.

On some architectures, specifically SH when configured with SPARSEMEM
memory model, assuming a struct page is always assigned to a memory
address lead to unexpected hangs during the virtual to page address
translation. This patch fixes that specific issue but applies in the
general case too.

It has now been clarified this patch does not resolve the issue, but only
mitigate it on platforms where dma_mmap_from_dev_coherent() succeeds and
delay page_to_pfn() faulty conversion.

A suggested proper solution would be not relying on dma_common_mmap() but
require all platforms to implement an mmap methods known to work, as noted
by Christoph in v1 review.

v1 -> v2:
- Save the 'pfn' temp variable performing the page_to_pfn() conversion in the
  remap_pfn_range() function call as suggested by Christoph.
