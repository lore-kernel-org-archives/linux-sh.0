Sure, an updated patch is below.
I also reworded the text to make it easier on my eyes,
I don't think the meaning has been altered.

I believe that Abe-san's team have come up against this,
I can confirm that if it is important.

arm: Add ARM ERRATA 782773 workaround

This is a workaround for Errata 782773 which effects all r0, r2 and r3
revisions.

The work-around avoids the possibility of an MMU exception in the case
where a page table walk occurs immediately after a page table update
that hasn't been flushed from the L1 data cache.
