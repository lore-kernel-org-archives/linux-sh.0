With the introduction of dma_request_slave_channel() we tried to
only change the cases going forward with DT, SFI and ACPI but
without changing the interface for the existing drivers, which
are highly inconsistent at the moment (filter function being defined
in the slave driver /or/ the platform /or/ the dmaengine driver).

I think what you suggest here is very similar to the existing
dma_request_slave_channel_compat() function, except that you
pass a string ("dmac0") instead of the filter function pointer,
and that string presumably also has to come from the platform,
since there is no other way for the driver to know it, right?

One idea that Vinod suggested was that the platform could register
a table of DMA configurations with the dmaengine core to do the
lookup by device and string. That would actually help unify the
API to the current dma_request_slave_channel(dev, name) form
for all the possible cases (DT, ACPI, SFI, platform_data).

In essence, the platform would have a table like clk_lookup
but also containing the config:

struct dma_lookup {
	struct list_head node;
	const char *dev_id;	/* the slave device */
	const char *con_id;	/* request line of the slave, e.g. "rx" */
	const char *dmadev_id;	/* master device name */
	void *slave_id;		/* data passed to the master */
};
