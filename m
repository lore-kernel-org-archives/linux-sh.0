Hello.

   Here's the set of 9 patches against the Simon Horman's 'renesas.git' repo,
'renesas-next-20130422' tag.  It was created to fix the shortcomings in the
R8A7779/Marzen USB platform code and R8A7779 USB common PHY driver, and so
spans both arch/arm/mach-shmobile/ and drivers/usb/ subtrees (some patches have
to touch both subtrees). The patches were conceived with the complete
bisectability goal in mind.

[1/9] ARM: shmobile: Marzen: move USB EHCI, OHCI, and PHY devices to R8A7779 code
[2/9] ehci-platform: add pre_setup() method to platform data
[3/9] ARM: shmobile: r8a7779: setup EHCI internal buffer
[4/9] rcar-phy: remove EHCI internal buffer setup
[5/9] ARM: shmobile: r8a7779: remove USB PHY 2nd memory resource
[6/9] rcar-phy: correct base address
[7/9] rcar-phy: add platform data
[8/9] ARM: shmobile: Marzen: pass platform data to USB PHY device
[9/9] rcar-phy: handle platform data

   Felipe, please ACK or NAK the rcar-phy patches ASAP. It's time consuming for
me to keep all these patches fresh atop of ever changing 'next' branch....

WBR, Sergei
