I think I made it clear that my use-case is enabling the crash utility. But I 
can re-state it now, no problem. ;)

I've already addressed this point as well. Fedora and RHEL ship with 
CONFIG_STRICT_DEVMEM=y. openSUSE and SLES ship with CONFIG_STRICT_DEVMEM=n.

Right. And even told you how RedHat "solved" that issue. They re-implemented 
the /dev/mem driver and called it /dev/crash. RHEL4 and RHEL5 included this as 
a separate module (called crash.ko), so you can at least blacklist it. With 
RHEL6, the driver is built into the kernel, so it's probably always there.

In short, if you're breaking into a system, remember to symlink /dev/rootkit 
to /dev/crash instead of /dev/mem, and your rootkit will continue to work. 
Anyway, I fail to see how this can be a problem. To acces /dev/mem you must 
have root privileges already, so what else does it protect?

I'm not sure what you mean. If you have a kernel compiled with 
CONFIG_STRICT_DEVMEM, then my patchset doesn't change anything in practice 
(unless you have an MMIO device mapped above 4G, in which case it will allow 
you to program it by writing to /dev/mem, instead of wrapping around to a 
random area in the first 4G and corrupting innocent data).

Hope that helps,
