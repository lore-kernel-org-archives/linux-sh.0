That will be difficult. This code is meant to use drivers that are not yet
DT-aware on DT-based systems. Hence it uses platform devices with named PM
domains, while the PM domains are described in DT.
I don't think there's another way to look up a PM domain by name, is there?

This code is meant to go away, once all drivers are converted to DT, or
considered obsolete.
