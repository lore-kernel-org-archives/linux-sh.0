Either making mmc_loader() CPU specific or allowing it
to take an argument should be pretty straight forward.

However, it is entirely unclear to me how the argument to mmc_loader()
would be supplied or alternatively the variant of mmc_loader() be
selected at run-time.

This code runs in very early boot. And as such I think that the two major
options are to either compile code in or pull it out of a register somehow.
We really don't have a whole lot of code that runs before mmc_loader() that
could do any kind of setup.
