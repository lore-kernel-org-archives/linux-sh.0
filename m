The prepare method being called from non-atomic context cannot be 
considered to be in a speed critical path.  Most of the time, this is 
going to be called on driver initialization or the like, and that's a 
relatively rare event. Therefore this really small cost to clk_prepare() 
is definitively worth it to help proper usage of the API.  If this ever 
becomes a problem then this could be confined to some CONFIG_CLK_DEBUG 
or the like.  But when introducing a new API it is best to be more 
strict to help people get its usage right (without going overboard with 
it of course).
