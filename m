Yep, thanks! Since the branches both come from parties that we normally
share branches with. I've cc:d them on this reply as well.

The only branch that isn't optimal is that it pulls in all of for-next from the
pinctrl tree, but it's OK for that tree in general. Having a dedicated topic
branch makes it a little harder to forget and accidentally rebase.

Note that it's pretty much ideal for us to be cc:d into the three-way handshake
that the remote branch will be guaranteed to be stable. The last thing we want
is that some of these people didn't quite understand what we need w.r.t.
stability (that has happened in the past). Especially if they feed their
branches up to another maintainer above them.

I'll merge in the dt3 branch with the above three as external dependency
branches.
