Hi Arnd,

Thanks for your review.

Are you referring to the comment "The controller does not support/use port 
I/O" in the driver for the internal PCI controller (pci-rcar-gen2.c)?
This is a separate block of hardware, it's a PCIe controller with external 
pins, for which we do support I/O regions.

Sure, the rest of the patch set adds this new PCIe driver and adds it to 
the R-Car devices & boards.

The devices that have this PCIe controller both have a number of fixed, 
non-contiguous memory regions that can be used as PCIe windows. The ranges 
here map onto those fixed windows, i.e. if the CPU addresses of the ranges 
change it won't work. The first couple of windows are small, we use the 
first one for I/O, we decided that we may as well use the next small 
window for memory - otherwise we need to figure out a way to tell the 
driver to skip a window.

Yes, and we've tested that as well.
