7 prepares for the move of PFC data from board code to drivers/. The branch 
mostly adds a pinctrl module for each of the supported SoCs, to allow later 
removal of PFC data from board code (in branches 8 and 9).

One way or the other all patches will need to be pulled. If they go through 
multiple trees we'll have to synchronize the multiple pull requests during the 
merge window, which looks pretty error-prone to me (but I might be wrong on 
this).

Sure, we could push 1-6 through the ARM tree, wait until it reaches mainline, 
then push 7 through the pinctrl tree, wait until it reaches mainline, push 8 
through the SH tree and 9 through the ARM tree, wait until they reach 
mainline, and finally push 10 through the pinctrl tree again. We could even 
push each branch through the tree it belongs to, but I doubt we'll be able to 
push everything during a single merge window.

I might be able to move 1 after 7, in which case we would have a single branch 
that would combine both and touch pinctrl only. The other dependencies seem 
pretty difficult to avoid.

What are the main issues with merging the branches in their current state (or 
possibly with 5 and 6 moved aside) through the ARM tree ?

4 moves platform device registration from the sh-pfc module to board code. 
Later pinctrl patches then remove platform device registration from the sh-pfc 
module completely and continue with the rework of the sh-pfc code. 7 thus 
strongly depends on 4.

You're right here. The non-pinctrl patches in 5 could go through a separate 
branch, they shouldn't depend on the pinctrl rework. 6 also has no dependency 
on the pinctrl rework.
