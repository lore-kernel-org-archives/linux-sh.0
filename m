I probably was a bit incorrect by saying "relies on". Right now the
complete suspend system is broken on ARM UP systems. So I think we can
use this patch without coordination regarding the other patch. It's
just when you want to test this here, then you need the above
mentioned patch to fix the system first before you can do anything.

Cheers,

 Bastian
