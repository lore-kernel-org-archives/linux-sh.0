I have no intention of making this change for arch/sh.

The __raw variants already accept both __iomem pointers and integer
addresses, which was largely intentional. New code could use the __iomem
annotations while older code could continue to use the integer addresses
without issue. If you wish to go through the kernel and audit every
single __raw user, you're certainly welcome to, but until then such a
change is premature.
