The devices are not allocated sequentially, so there is no easy way to
look them up.

There is a comment for find_memory_block():

"For now, we have a linear search to go find the appropriate
memory_block corresponding to a particular phys_index. If this gets to
be a real problem, we can always use a radix tree or something here."

So if this becomes a problem, we need a separate data structure to speed
up the lookup. (IOW, this was already the same in the old code)

Thanks!
