I've now given the patches in this series a spin on top of
renesas-devel-v3.14-rc8-20140325v2.

To clarify, I can't seem to find any cover letter for this series, so
instead I will with this email reply to [1/1]. Here is also a list of
the patches that I believe are part of this series, please correct me
if I'm wrong:

[PATCH V2 1/5] ARM: shmobile: r8a7791: add IIC0/1 clock macros
[PATCH V2 2/5] ARM: shmobile: r8a7791: add IIC(B) clocks to dtsi
[PATCH V2 3/5] ARM: shmobile: r8a7791: add IIC(B) cores to dtsi
[PATCH V2 4/5] ARM: shmobile: koelsch: make i2c2-pfc node unique
[PATCH V2 5/5] ARM: shmobile: koelsch: activate i2c6 bus

They all look good to me!

Simon, can you please pick up these changes? I believe there are no
special dependencies.

Thanks,
