memory-to-device-to-device case, it is indeed using memory-to-device and device-to-device.
But, DMAEngine point of view, above device-to-device interface/style is same as memory-to-device.
memory-to-device case needs ID + "memory address"   + "register address".
device-to-device case needs ID + "register address" + "register address".
It is implemented in ${LINUX}/drivers/dma/sh/rcar-audmapp.c,
and used from ${LINUX}/sound/soc/sh/rcar/core.c with generic dmaengine interface/binding.
