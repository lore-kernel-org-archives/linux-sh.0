AutoRTS/autoCTS cannot be enabled yet from DT.
Hence on DT platforms, the driver uses either gpio-based RTS/CTS, or no RTS/CTS
at all.

There's indeed no interrupt support for that, unless you use a GPIO.

OK, so it's the responsibility of the driver to poll CTS, if there's no CTS
interrupt support. Even when autoCTS is enabled.

But if the hardware has autoCTS, we should use it, right?
Hence "... without autoCTS" is never true if the hardware has autoCTS?

BTW, this means that drivers using mctrl_gpio_init_noauto(), but not
implementing autoCTS(), and not polling CTS are broken?

drivers/tty/serial/clps711x.c looks fishy: it doesn't poll CTS, but always sets
TIOCM_CTS, probably to work around this?

That's also my understanding: to manually control the RTS pin, you have to
disable automatic flow control (or use pinmux to change the pin to a GPIO).

OK, makes sense. That's also what I was guessing. So when autoRTS is enabled,
we have either state 2 or state 3.

Now, why would you want to override RTS output, and is [*] above an issue?
Is it because you want autoCTS, but not autoRTS?

Thanks for your answers, and sorry for still having that many questions...
