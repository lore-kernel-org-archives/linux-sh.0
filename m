OK.  From what you said below, it sounds like you would add a DT entry
for the bus range you want to have below this bridge, and use TYPE0
accesses for the base of that range.

I'm not sure how you reconcile this with the idea that the bios32 code
just increments a bus number for each controller.

Yeah, I guess.  If the HW really doesn't look at the bus number at
all, it sounds like the range is effectively 00-ff, and each host
bridge should be in its own domain.
