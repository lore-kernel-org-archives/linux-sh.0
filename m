There is no reason why they couldnt use a .config option or a boot 
option to get their weird stuff going, which weird stuff also happens 
to be useful.

What i'm somewhat against is having this enabled by default for weird 
stuff that also happens to be harmful - and the fact that it never 
worked over 4G physical gives us the perfect opportunity to do just 
that.
