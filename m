I think for generic pin controllers either nodes with:

{
    function = "foo";
    pins = "A0", "A1", "A2";
}

or

{
    function = "foo";
    groups = "bar", "baz";
}

In parsing this it's easy to just look for "function" then see if
we're mapping to groups or pins.

It'd be nice if we could then centralize parsing of functions/pins/groups
and add the non-renesas-prefixed configs as alternatives to genericized
the bindings, while keeping backward compatibility.

Yours,
Linus Walleij
