Hmm.. I wonder if we should assign core->req_rate to be the same as
core->rate during __clk_init()? That would make this call to
clk_core_set_rate_nolock() a nop in this case.

We need to call clk_core_set_rate_nolock() here to drop any min/max rate
request that this consumer has.

It seems like we've also exposed a bug in cpg_div6_clock_calc_div().
Technically any driver could have called clk_round_rate() with a zero
rate before this change and that would have caused the same division by
zero.
