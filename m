Hi Olof, Hi Arnd,

This revised pull-request includes a build-warning fix by myself.
The build-warning was reported by Arnd and has been acked by Greg
Kroah-Hartman.

I apologise that this is now coming very late in the cycle, this is
mostly due to the time it took to address the build-warning.

I also apologise that I have not yet addressed your request to
drop your addresses from the CC list of the patch emails
that follow this one. I will do so before I start sending patches
for v3.12.
