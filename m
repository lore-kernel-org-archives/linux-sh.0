So, what exactly does ap4evb_clk_optimize() do that you can't already do
with either clk_rate_table_round() or clk_rate_div_range_round()?

I really don't want to see this sort of rate table access going on
outside of the clock framework itself, so if we need to add or extend an
existing helper for a new usecase then that is highly preferable to
constantly reinventing things.
