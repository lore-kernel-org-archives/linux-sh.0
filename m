Except that, AFAIK, arch/blackfin/mach-xxx is much similar with
arch/arm/mach-xxx with a lot of platform, i2c, spi board information.
it is probably we can also benefit from device tree as what ARM is
doing.
but not sure whether it is really worthwhile for the current situation
and long term plan of blackfin. Anyway, there are not so many blackfin
SoC and boards as ARM.
