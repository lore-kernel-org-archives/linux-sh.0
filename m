v5:
  - Add Reviewed-by,
  - "simple-pm-bus" is not an extension of "simple-bus",
  - "compatible" must not contain "simple-bus",
  - Add reference to clock/PM domain provider binding docs,

v4:
  - Replace "simple-bus" by "simple-pm-bus",
  - Remove the "renesas,bsc" bindings. They will be specified in a
    separate document.

v3:
  - Add Tested-by,
  - Document required properties inherited from "simple-bus",
  - Document required "reg" property for "renesas,bsc",
  - Move "ranges" before "reg" in the example,

v2:
  - New.

+Simple Power-Managed Bus
+============
+
+A Simple Power-Managed Bus is a transparent bus that doesn't need a real
+driver, as it's typically initialized by the boot loader.
+
+However, its bus controller is part of a PM domain, or under the control of a
+functional clock.  Hence, the bus controller's PM domain and/or clock must be
+enabled for child devices connected to the bus (either on-SoC or externally)
+to function.
+
+While "simple-pm-bus" follows the "simple-bus" set of properties, as specified
+in ePAPR, it is not an extension of "simple-bus".
+
+
+Required properties:
+  - compatible: Must contain at least "simple-pm-bus".
+		Must not contain "simple-bus".
+		It's recommended to let this be preceded by one or more
+		vendor-specific compatible values.
+  - #address-cells, #size-cells, ranges: Must describe the mapping between
+		parent address and child address spaces.
+
+Optional platform-specific properties for clock or PM domain control (at least
+one of them is required):
+  - clocks: Must contain a reference to the functional clock(s),
+  - power-domains: Must contain a reference to the PM domain.
+Please refer to the binding documentation for the clock and/or PM domain
+providers for more details.
+
+
+Example:
+
+	bsc: bus@fec10000 {
+		compatible = "renesas,bsc-sh73a0", "renesas,bsc",
+			     "simple-pm-bus";
+		#address-cells = <1>;
+		#size-cells = <1>;
+		ranges = <0 0 0x20000000>;
+		reg = <0xfec10000 0x400>;
+		interrupts = <0 39 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
+		clocks = <&zb_clk>;
+		power-domains = <&pd_a4s>;
+	};
