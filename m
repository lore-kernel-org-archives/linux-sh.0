MMC/SD/SDIO standard sets the requirement and must somehow "notify" the 
host about how to act in certain scenarios.

Just for information, I think one interesting host driver to look at is 
omap_hsmmc. For it's enable function is does pm_runtime_get_sync and for 
it's disable function it does pm_runtime_put_autosuspend, this to make 
sure the clock is enabled when it is needed.

You might be right; but still we need a way for the mmc framework to 
prevent the host driver from disabling clock etc to the card for some 
command sequences. As the omap driver solves it is to implement the 
enable/disable function and then call for get_sync and put in these 
functions, maybe that is the way how to solve this!?
