You are right. I haven' made it fully clear in this post. But I did in
previous posts eg:

"This series of patches adds support for the Dreamcast Visual Memory
Unit, reworking the maple bus code to ensure it supports asynchronous
reads and writes. A consequential amendment to the keyboard driver is
also included."

I know you read them because you commented on the code.

The VMU will not work without changes in the bus code because the
existing bus code relies on periodic polling (eg the keyboard is polled
50 times a second). That plainly won't work with a block device.

(The keyboard and joystick changes are minor and consequential to
changes made to eliminate some of the memory hacks you disliked
previously)

I could have posted it all as one patch but given that there are three
different maintainers here - Greg KH for the bus code, Dmitry for the
input layer and David Woodhouse for the MTD device it seemed pretty
sensible to me to break the code up in that way.

Unfortunately the hardware is quite flaky and that causes race
conditions (eg block writes can be so slow it can look like the device
has been removed). But I have also had issues in getting the locking
right - particularly as clone devices (and I wrote the first round
against one) behave slightly differently from SEGA devices.

They are broken out. As I said - bus, mtd device and input devices.

Small incremental patches won't work. The bus code has to change to
support the device. The device is obviously a new file and the input
changes are consequential to the bus changes.
