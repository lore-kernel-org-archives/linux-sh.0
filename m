Another problem that resources solve (and your original patch didn't 
make it any better nor worse) has to do with include file search paths.  
Once we start building more than one SOC in the kernel, we won't be able 
to support the inclusion of <mach/whatever.h> from driver code anymore 
since this could refer to more than one instances of 
arch/arm/mach-*/include/mach/whatever.h.
