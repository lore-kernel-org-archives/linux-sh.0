Hi Linus and Thomas,

I realized that the merge window is now imminent, but I had not sent a
pull request to Thomas for the current y2038 stuff. These patches have
been around for a while though, and were in linux-next through my tree.

I got one bug report on Monday and incorporated a simple fix, which
changed the commit date for the second half of the series, in case you
are wondering.

Thomas, is it ok for you to just provide an Ack for this branch and
have Linus merge it directly?

  timekeeping: remove obsolete time accessors (2018-12-18 16:13:05 +0100)

y2038: more syscalls and cleanups

This concludes the main part of the system call rework for 64-bit time_t,
which has spread over most of year 2018, the last six system calls being

 - ppoll
 - pselect6
 - io_pgetevents
 - recvmmsg
 - futex
 - rt_sigtimedwait

As before, nothing changes for 64-bit architectures, while 32-bit
architectures gain another entry point that differs only in the layout
of the timespec structure. Hopefully in the next release we can wire up
all 22 of those system calls on all 32-bit architectures, which gives
us a baseline version for glibc to start using them.

This does not include the clock_adjtime, getrusage/waitid, and
getitimer/setitimer system calls. I still plan to have new versions
of those as well, but they are not required for correct operation of
the C library since they can be emulated using the old 32-bit time_t
based system calls.

Aside from the system calls, there are also a few cleanups here,
removing old kernel internal interfaces that have become unused after
all references got removed. The arch/sh cleanups are part of this,
there were posted several times over the past year without a reaction
from the maintainers, while the corresponding changes made it into all
other architectures.
