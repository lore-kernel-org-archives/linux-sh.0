Update the CMT clocksource rating from 100 to 10.

This resolves a boot-failure regression for kzm9g-reference in v3.10-rc1
introduced by f7db706b132f11c79ae1d74b2382e0926cf31644 ("ARM: 7674/1: smp:
Avoid dummy clockevent being preferred over real").

The patch noted above reduces the rating of dummy clockevent from 400 to 100.
This patch reduces the rating of CMT so that it is once again less than that
of the dummy clockevent.

I also plan to reduce the rating of the STI clocksource to less than 100.
However, as I am not aware of any problems relating to STI in v3.10-rc
my plan is to update STI in the v3.11 timeframe.
