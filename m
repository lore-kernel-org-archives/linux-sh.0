Okay, so the first question is can we have multiple PRECHANGE notfication
done without any POSTCHANGE inbetween?
- Scenario: One reading value of cpuinfo_cur_freq, which will call
__cpufreq_cpu_get()->cpufreq_out_of_sync()->cpufreq_notify_transition()..

And ondemand governor trying to change freq of cpu and so doing notification..

There can be more similar scenarios possible..


Now Second question, is this fine to have multiple PRECHANGE notfications
before any POSTCHANGE notification?

Logically it looks obvious to me that these must be serialized..
Otherwise this is what we are broadcasting:
- We are changing for freq X, please prepare and let us know if you are
okay with it..
- Oh.. So sorry, we are changing to freq Y instead, please adjust accordingly.

- Yes we have changed to freq Y...
- Yes we have changed to freq X...

This looks stupid, isn't it? I don't know how the drivers would behave when
they see such notifications and so got to this patch initially..
