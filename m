These two should actually go in in v4.3, as they're bugfixes for commits that
are in v4.3-rc1. That can be done in parallel, though.

Sound will stop working in mainline as soon as commit cbc41d0a761bffb3
("drivers: sh: Disable PM runtime for multi-platform ARM with genpd") in
sh-drivers-for-v4.3 enters mainline.

when I'm talking to journalists I just say "programmer" or something like that.
