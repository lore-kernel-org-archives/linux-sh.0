The problem is, most likely, that with CONFIG_PM_RUNTIME set the code in
drivers/sh/pm_runtime.c triggers and that causes default_pm_domain to be
used.

So, I don't really think we need to "fix" every driver in turn,
default_pm_domain seems to be what needs fixing.  I'm not exactly sure
how to fix it at the moment, though.

You can verify if my suspicion is correct quite easily by replacing the
(&default_pm_domain) in drivers/sh/pm_runtime.c with NULL.

Thanks,
Rafael
