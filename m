Hi all,

here is v2 of this series. On the functional side, adding the support
for USB mux groups is probably the biggest change. Most other changes
are mostly cosmetic (typos, function names, documentation, ...).
More detailed changelogs are included with the respective patches.

Regarding DT, I separated pinconf from pinmux nodes and updated
documentation accordingly to enforce that separation.
The parser, though, still handles everything in order to not break
backwards compatibility.

And finally, as Linus requested, I patched one of the Qualcomm drivers
to use the features added in 'pinctrl: pinconf-generic: Allow driver to
specify DT params'. I don't have that HW so, that is compile tested only
and may take some more work to work on HW.

So much for the changes. What didn't change? I left the parts that have
been described as "kludgy" as they were, in order to maintain backwards
compatibility and not break current users of pinconf-generic
functionality.

The audience is again limited to pinctrl stakeholders.

	Thanks,
	S=C3=B6ren
