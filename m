The problem that I was trying to address was that
"ARM: shmobile: Remove legacy KZM9D board code" removes
legacy board code and thus the following line from
arch/arm/mach-shmobile/Makefile.boot

loadaddr-$(CONFIG_MACH_KZM9D) += 0x40008000

My understanding is that a result of this change is that
CONFIG_AUTO_ZRELADDR is now needed in order for the kernel
to compile.

Is it appropriate to set CONFIG_AUTO_ZRELADDR in Kconfig?
Or is there another approach that I could take?

Yes, I believe so.

We have added ARCH_SHMOBILE_MULTI.

The changelog entry describes the motivation for the change as well as I
could.  My view on this is that its global change that avoids an even more
widespread global change.

    ARM: Rename ARCH_SHMOBILE to ARCH_SHMOBILE_LEGACY

    SH-Mobile platforms are transitioning from non-multiplatform to
    multiplatform kernel. A new ARCH_SHMOBILE_MULTI configuration symbol has
    been created to group all multiplatform-enabled SH-Mobile SoCs. The
    existing ARCH_SHMOBILE configuration symbol groups SoCs that haven't
    been converted yet.

    This arrangement works fine for the arch/ code, but lots of drivers
    needed on both ARCH_SHMOBILE and ARCH_SHMOBILE_MULTI depend on
    ARCH_SHMOBILE only. In order to avoid changing them, rename
    ARCH_SHMOBILE to ARCH_SHMOBILE_LEGACY, and create a new boolean
    ARCH_SHMOBILE configuration symbol that is selected by both
    ARCH_SHMOBILE_LEGACY and ARCH_SHMOBILE_MULTI.
