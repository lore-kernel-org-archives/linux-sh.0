Add Clock Domain support to the R-Car Gen2 Clock Pulse Generator (CPG)
driver using the generic PM Domain.  This allows to power-manage the
module clocks of SoC devices that are part of the CPG Clock Domain using
Runtime PM, or for system suspend/resume.

SoC devices that are part of the CPG Clock Domain and can be
power-managed through an MSTP clock should be tagged in DT with a proper
"power-domains" property.

v2:
  - Add Acked-by and Reviewed-by,
  - Move core CPG Clock Domain code from the R-Car Gen2 driver to the
    CPG MSTP Clocks driver, as it's generic, and can be used on other
    Renesas SoCs that have a CPG/MSTP block,
  - Scan for an MSTP clock instead of using the first clock tied to the
    device (con_id NULL),
  - Extract R-Car Gen2 specifics from "[PATCH/RFC 1/5] clk: shmobile:
    rcar-gen2: Add CPG Clock Domain support" into this patch.

 The CPG generates core clocks for the R-Car Gen2 SoCs. It includes three PLLs
 and several fixed ratio dividers.
