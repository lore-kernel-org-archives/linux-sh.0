Sorry, could you clarify, how it is valid? No, I'm not proposing to revive 
this patch, just curious, what exactly you meant by this. AFAICS NULL is 
never returned from regulator_get(). The value, that's returned by it is 
then directly dereferenced in other regulator API calls, for which you 
don't normally want a NULL. So, having a regulator pointer = NULL seems 
to be as valid to me as causing a BUG() is? :-)
