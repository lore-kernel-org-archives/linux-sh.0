In the long run yes, but there is no need to hurry. I just want to stop
more of this from getting added because at some point we might have to
change it all.

Hard to say. Depends on whether there will be an -rc7. Sooner is better,
but again I care more about the new stuff here than about changing the
existing bits.

Do you actually need to do anything at init_early() or map_io() time
that needs debugging these days?
We already have too many different ways of doing early console output,
but if you cannot use the drivers/tty/serial/8250/8250_early.c code,
maybe it makes sense to just move the map_io() call for your 8250
port into that driver.

Don't worry about SMP and clocks for now for moving to DT, just do
the easy bits that are directly connected to the SoC and that have
existing bindings or those that can be trivially added.
