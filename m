Hi again,

I did a quick retry in re-basing my patches, but realized that it
requires quite some work.

With a quite small effort I did manage to improve the code in
->probe() and in ->set_ios(), related to runtime PM and clock
management. I will post these patches after the weekend, but
unfortunate I doubt these will fix the problem you reported here.
Although, please help and test them.

To fix the problem properly, one should probable re-write the locking
and the state machine code in the driver, because it's rather messy
and has likely problems.
As a quick fix, one could validate pointers before accessing them in
the sh_mmcif_irqt() function, because that's not done currently.

So to be clear, this is all can help with currently. I wish I could
help more, but I have limited bandwidth and no HW to test on. :-)

Kind regards
Uffe
