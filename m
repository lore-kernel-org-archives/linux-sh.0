But we're free to set the rules here, as we're dealing with new code. We could 
for instance mandate that all Renesas IP cores specify their functional clock 
as "fck" in DT, and enforce that rule in new drivers. As we're not dealing 
with external platform devices we should be in full control.

If future IP cores require more than one clock to be automatically managed 
we'll need to come up with a naming scheme anyway, and backward compatibility 
will need to be taken into account, regardless of whether we use the NULL 
clock or a named clock today.
