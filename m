Hi Simon, Magnus,

The legacy platforms are meant to be extinct in the near future, but
Armadillo-legacy already has some PM domain support, so adding a
little bit more can't hurt much, IMHO.

Besides diff noise, there should not be any dependencies on WIP patches.

"[PATCH 03/11] [WIP] ARM: shmobile: armadillo800eva legacy: Add
missing A3SP pm domain devices" should be OK, as this turned out to be
intended behavior.

"[PATCH 10/11] [WIP] ARM: shmobile: r8a7740: Add A4SU pm domain
 support" probably introduces a regression for USB, as the domain is now
powered down after boot-up. I haven't tried USB on Armadillo yet, though.
So don't apply this one.

"[PATCH 11/11] [WIP] ARM: shmobile: r8a7740: Add A3SM pm domain
 support" should be safe.

I would not apply the other WIP patches that add C99-commented-out code.
These issues must be fixed for DT as well.

Thanks!

Gr{oetje,eeting}s,
