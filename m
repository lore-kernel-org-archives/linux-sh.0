Well, we prefer to bring in dependencies like these explicitly. Since Simon has
the branch in the pull request he sent, we prefer to keep a copy of it around
for tracking purposes.

Everythign seems fine. It's just that we've been burnt before by other
maintainers rebasing a branch that someone else has pulled in, and all hell
breaking lose. Because of that we make sure that there's the three-way
handshake about this (us, you and Simon).
