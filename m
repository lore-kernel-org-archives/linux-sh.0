Yup. This gic_spi() macro is completely doomed, as it computes a
hardware interrupt where the kernel expects a virtual one. The only way
to fix this is to init the GIC outside of DT, so that we stick to a
legacy irqdomain. You can still use information from DT, but you can't
rely on irqchip_init() to produce something that a legacy platform can use.

OK, that's indeed the expected result.

I'm a bit lost looking at the shmobile code. But I agree, kzm9g should
die a painful death, as it has the same level of breakage as armadillo.
