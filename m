There were two (important ones for my point below) more here:

+       default 0xffe40000 if DEBUG_SCIF && ARCH_R8A7778
+       default 0xffe42000 if DEBUG_SCIF && ARCH_R8A7779

I thought about having separate Kconfig entries for the various serial ports,
until I started realizing that
(a) not all serial ports are at the same addresses on all SoCs (most
are, though),
    The list above corresponds to these ports and addresses (note that we
    have multiple scif0 and scif2):

        scifa0: serial@e6c40000
        scifa1: serial@e6c50000
        scifa4: serial@e6c80000
        scif2: serial@e6e58000
        scif0: serial@e6e60000
        scif2: serial@e8008000
        scif0: serial@ffe40000
        scif2: serial@ffe42000

(b) this would just add lots of sections with similar lines in Kconfig.debug.
E.g. compare

    default 0xe6c50000 if DEBUG_SCIF && ARCH_R8A7740

to

    config DEBUG_RENESAS_SCIFA1
        bool "Kernel low-level debugging messages via SCIFA1 on
Renesas ARM SoCs"
        depends on DEBUG_RENESAS_SCIF && ARCH_R8A7740
        help
                [ ....]


    default 0xe6c50000 if DEBUG_RENESAS_SCIFA1

and repeat for all serial ports...
Or do you mean something different?

It's not guaranteed to work if you have a kernel with support for multiple
SoCs, as some SoCs still use machine_desc.map_io(), while others don't.
ARCH_R8A73A4 and ARCH_SH7372 use the same serial port at the same
address, but ARCH_SH7372 uses machine_desc.map_io().

Note that also encoding the SoC names/families, and offering a choice option
out of

DEBUG_RENESAS_R8A73A4_SCIFA0
DEBUG_RENESAS_SH7372_SCIFA0
DEBUG_RENESAS_R8A7740_SCIFA1
DEBUG_RENESAS_SH73A0_SCIFA4
DEBUG_RENESAS_RCAR_GEN2_SCIF2
DEBUG_RENESAS_RCAR_GEN2_SCIF0
DEBUG_RENESAS_R7S72100_SCIF2
DEBUG_RENESAS_RCAR_GEN1_SCIF0
DEBUG_RENESAS_RCAR_GEN1_SCIF2

could be used to solve the machine_desc.map_io() issue.
Then we can have hardcoded addresses based on the above.

I prefer to optimize the user experience for the common case, i.e.
autoselection for the SoC you're using, and manual edit for the less common
case.
