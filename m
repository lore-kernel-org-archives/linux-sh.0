I've merged this in, not doing a separate branch for the clk patches.

I've merged this in under next/drivers, since the clock tables that are changed
are hopefully finding their way into drivers/clk in the not too distant future.

Let me know if this will add complications w.r.t. merge dependencies and we can
bring this back into next/soc, but unless you also change clock code in later
soc branches, they can just be independent of this.
