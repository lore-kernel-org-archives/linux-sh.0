That seems to be something to fit into "[PATCH 00/11 v6] Coresight framework
and drivers" (https://lkml.org/lkml/2014/9/11/733)?

However, if I'm not mistaken, while that series introduces extensive handling
based on the presence of Coresight device nodes in DT, it looks like it doesn't
affect the current direct accesses to the debug registers in hw_breakpoint.c?

For now, do you consider it acceptable to introduce a global bool (defaulting
to true) to track whether accessing the debug registers is allowed?

Right, that's definitely not optimal.
I guess this also applies to the existing (ab)users of debug_reg_hook?

Thanks!
