Not strictly speaking a problem with this patch, but I was wondering...

Do we know for sure that the mmu context has been fully flushed out
before the unplug ? idle_task_exit() will do a context switch but in our
case that may not be enough.

Once the CPU is offline, tlb flushes won't hit it any more so it can get
out of sync (in some cases the offlining process is just some kind of
deep sleep loop that doesn't involve a TLB state loss).

Should we add a flush_tlb_mm of all those bits in that loop ? that would
be a tad expensive... we don't have a flush_tlb_all() as a generic kind
of accessors, but we could add something like that as a requirement for
ppc_md.cpu_die ?

Cheers,
Ben.
