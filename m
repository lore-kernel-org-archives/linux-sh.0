The way that I see things is that with the last patch in this series
there are two files using these enums, one under arch/sh and one under
arch/arm. They both relate to using MMCIF. And they both assume that
there are states we are interested in that can be usefully displayed.
If SHDI can make use of this it may make sense to move it somewhere
else at that time.

OTOH, its just 4 integers and this is really just debugging code.
I wouldn't be opposed to removing it altogether.
