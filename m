I'm not sure I would call this parent clock. It refers to the frequency of the 
functional clock provided to the MMCIF, there's no concept of parent there. 
True, the clock referenced by the MMCIF DT node is an MSTP gate clock, and 
frequency control is implemented in the MSTP clock parent, but that hardware 
architecture is internal to the CPG and shouldn't be considered by the MMCIF.

The real question is where the constraint comes from. The Gen2 datasheet 
documents the MMC clocks maximum frequency as 97.5 MHz in the CPG section. 
However, I have a feeling the constraint doesn't come from the DIV6 which 
should be able to output higher frequencies, but from the MMCIF, the clock 
distribution tree, or both.

There's also the option of specifying the admissible clock range in DT, either 
in the CPG node or the MMCIF node.
