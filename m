Is it still possible to drop the above commit?
This branch was rebased on v3.19-rc1[*], where this is no longer needed, and
even has bad (as in suboptimal; fortunately it does not crash) side effects:

    As of commit b2b49ccbdd547135 ("PM: Kconfig: Set PM_RUNTIME if PM_SLEEP
    is selected"), CONFIG_PM_RUNTIME is always enabled if CONFIG_PM is
    enabled, so this section is no longer needed.

    As of commit 464ed18ebdb6236f ("PM: Eliminate CONFIG_PM_RUNTIME"),
    CONFIG_PM_RUNTIME no longer exists, and this section will always be
    executed, which may enable clocks that are not needed.

Anyway, I've sent a revert, too
(http://marc.info/?l=linux-sh&m1987158302176&w=2).

Thanks!

BTW, this happened because this series was originally intended for 3.19, but
postponed to 3.20 because a dependency entered mainline only in a late
3.18-rc*, when arm-soc for 3.19 was about to close.

[*] If it wouldn't have been rebased, the issue would have shown up after the
    merge into post-v3.19-rc1 anyway, and would have needed a revert.
