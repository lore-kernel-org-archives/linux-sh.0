Sure, that sounds reasonable - though it seems somewhat orthogonal to my series.

I'll check over the code, but it seems that you are implying that
the masks never change.

The current split was intended to make bite-size patches that
are easy to review. I'm happy to combine the patches as you
suggest if that is what you prefer.

I think I see what you are getting at there.
I will try and make it so.

I agree the current loop isn't entirely clean.
I'll unroll it and see how things look.

Sure, if you would prefer that naming scheme.

The motivation behind that aspect of the implementation is
to allow re-use of code while avoiding extra register reads.

I believe the two sdio functions could be collapsed into a single function
while only losing (probably unused) debugging information. I will do that,
though I decided against that option previously for the sake of consistency.

For the card_irq() functions I think it is a bit difficult to collapse things
because the access and detect handlers actually need to read the same
register(s).
