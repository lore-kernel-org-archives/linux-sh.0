Changes in version 4:
- refreshed the patch.

Changes in version 3:
- changed subnodes of the USB PHY node to be per-channel;
- changed "renesas,phy-select" property to "reg" in the subnodes, and thus added
  "#address-cells" and "#size-cells" properties to the parent node;
- moved "#phy-cells" property from the parent node to the subnodes, changing its
  value to <1>;
- refreshed the patch.

Changes in version 2:
- added subnodes to the USB PHY node;
- refreshed the patch.
