You didn't do the 26 steps of SubmitChecklist, as step 5 would have
caught almost all of these issues.

But you didn't cc: me on that, how am I supposed to know?

No, you need to break your patch up properly, a single patch hitting all
of these files has never been ok.

Seriously?  It's one thing to cc: a ton of people with a patch that for
90% of it, isn't relevant to them, and isn't even something they can do
anything with.  It's another thing to rant against those who try to
point out how to solve your issues.

There is no such thing here, you know better than that, stop trying to
troll, it's not very becoming.
