It's upon linux-next and the "not yet pulled" pxa tree merged :
 - http://lists.infradead.org/pipermail/linux-arm-kernel/2015-March/331119.html
I think it will appear once arm-soc has been prepared for linux-next and pulled.

This specific merge window will shift pxa architecture to common clock
framework, that's why I saw the regression.

Cheers.
