links to the USB PHY device.

This patch is against 'renesas-devel-v3.15-rc7-20140526' tag of Simon Horman's
'renesas.git' repo plus R8A7791/Koelsch/Henninger PCI and USB PHY support
patches posted before.  The patch requires the internal PCI DT support, USB PHY
driver, and USB HCD generic PHY support (also already posted) in order to work.

Changes in version 2:
- renamed the PCI OHCI/EHCI device nodes to comply with the PCI binding;
- changed the PHY specifier in the PCI#1 node to reflect that channel #1 support
  was dropped;
- resolved rejects.
