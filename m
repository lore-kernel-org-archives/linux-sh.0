It's always good to get a heads up that there will be conflicts.
Simple conflicts like these are perfectly fine to expose though.

It's sometimes good to get a reference resolution of them from you --
for example in this case I had originally resolved the conflict
differently from you in your version of the merge (that was part of
the boards branch), so I had to go back and redo it to not cause extra
conflicts there.
