The Kconfig symbol ARCH_HAS_OPP became redundant in v3.16: commit
049d595a4db3 ("PM / OPP: Make OPP invisible to users in Kconfig")
removed the only dependency that used it. Setting it had no effect
anymore.

So commit 78c5e0bb145d ("PM / OPP: Remove ARCH_HAS_OPP") removed it. For
some reason that commit did not remove all select statements for that
symbol. These statements are now useless. Remove one from shmobile too.

Sent previously as part of the treewide patch "PM / OPP: Remove
ARCH_HAS_OPP completely". But it turns out the changes for omap2 are
already queued in omap-for-v3.18/soc (but not in linux-next!). Besides,
Simon Horman wanted the shmobile change split off.

Done on top of next-20140922. Tested by grepping the tree.
