Hello,

This is the second version of the CCF clock drivers for the Renesas R-Car
R8A7790 (H2) SoC.

The patches are pretty self-explanatory and described in their respective
commit message. The R8A7790 datasheet is unfortunately not publicly available.

The code is available in my git tree at

        git://linuxtv.org/pinchartl/fbdev.git clocks/ccf/r8a7790

The branch is based on a merge of renesas-devel-v3.12-rc7-20131101, v3.12, and
clk-prepare patches I've posted earlier on the list (see "[PATCH 00/12] Prepare
various SH/R Mobile/Car drivers for CCF migration").

Changes compared to v1:

- The core CPG clocks driver now supports the r8a7791 SoC in addition to the
r8a7790. They are collectively refered to as 'R-Car Gen2'. The driver has thus
been renamed to clk-rcar-gen2.c. The DT bindings have been updated accordingly.

- Several MSTP clocks have been added to the r8a7790-clock.h header and a new
header has been added for the r8a7791

- The r8a7790 dtsi patches that add and reference clocks have been added to
this series.
