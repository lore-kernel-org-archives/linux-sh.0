Thanks, pulled. Quite annoying conflicts since I hit them twice, likely because
we had resolved the merge conflicts independenty.

Anyway, not a huge deal. It'd have been nice if the branch had been based on
the fix to the USB code that caused the whole move of code to be considered
a conflict, something to maybe consider next time.
