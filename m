I have now had a chance to re-examine these patches and it seems to me that
the first four patches of the series not depend on the BSC driver (or
anything else).  With that in mind I have queued them up in a new
r8a73a4-ccf-for-v3.21 branch which is present in
renesas-devel-20150123-v3.19-rc5.

Please take a moment to see if what I have done makes sense to you.  In
particular it would be nicer if these patches could go into 'regular'
branches such as dt-for-v3.21 and soc-for-v3.21. However it seems to me
that the SoC patch "ARM: shmobile: ape6evm: Disable legacy clock
initialization" depends on the following two DT patche " "ARM: shmobile:
r8a73a4: Common clock framework DT description".

For reference this covers the following patches:

Enqueued (again):

Ulrich Hecht (6):
  ARM: shmobile: r8a73a4: Add CPG register bits header
  ARM: shmobile: r8a73a4: Common clock framework DT description
  ARM: shmobile: ape6evm: Disable legacy clock initialization
  ARM: shmobile: r8a73a4: Add MSTP clock assignments to DT

Left Unqueued:

Geert Uytterhoeven (2):
  ARM: shmobile: r8a73a4 dtsi: Add Bus State Controller node
  ARM: shmobile: ape6evm dts: Move Ethernet node to BSC

Laurent Pinchart (1):
  ARM: shmobile: r8a73a4: Remove legacy code

Ulrich Hecht (6):
  ARM: shmobile: ape6evm-reference: Remove board C code and DT file
  ARM: shmobile: r8a73a4: ape6evm: Remove legacy platform
