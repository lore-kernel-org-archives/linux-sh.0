[PATCH 1/6 v3] mmc: tmio: implement SDIO IRQ
[PATCH 2/6 v3] mfd: sh_mobile_sdhi: activate SDIO IRQ for tmio_mmc
[PATCH 3/6 v3] ARM: mach-shmobile: sh7372 Enable SDIO IRQs
[PATCH 4/6 v3] sh: sh7724 Enable SDIO IRQs
[PATCH 5/6 v3] sh: sh7722 Enable SDIO IRQs
[PATCH 6/6 v3] sh: sh7723 / ap325rxa enable SDIO IRQs

These patches add SDIO IRQ support for the tmio mmc cell
of the sh_mobile_sdhi mfd and activate the usage of
SDIO IRQs on all SoCs where sh_mobile_sdhi is currently
used.

The patchset depends on:
    mmc: tmio_mmc: allow multi-element scatter-gather lists
        https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/317142/
    mmc: tmio_mmc: fix PIO fallback on DMA descriptor allocation failure
        https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/317162/
    mmc: tmio: merge the private header into the driver
        https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/349931/
    mmc: tmio: implement a bounce buffer for unaligned DMA
        https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/349941/

Changes in v3:
- Drop the patch which disables IRQs early in remove
  it caused hangs during rmmod
- Disable device IRQ in tmio_mmc_clk_start/stop to
  avoid spurious SDIO IRQs (previously there was a
  small time window where this could happen)
- Fix a null pointer dereference which would have been
  triggered when spurious SDIO IRQs would have been generated
- Include patch for sh7723 / ap325rx

Changes in v2:
- Add TMIO_MMC_SDIO_IRQ flag, which expresses that  the hardware is known
  to support SDIO IRQ as suggested by Magnus Damm
- Activate this flag for sh_mobile_sdhi
- Add a patch which disables IRQs early in remove
  to avoid spurious SDIO IRQs, during module unload
- Patches 4-6 are unmodified but included for
  completeness
