My plan is to slowly getting rid of sh7372 bit by bit. This since the
sh7372 SoC never made it into mass production and it's getting old. As
for AP4EVB, it's the first sh7372 board that we ran Linux on. It was
soon replaced by Mackerel.

So sh7372 was something we worked on a couple of generations ago. The
sh7372 SoC code has issues related to DT for INTC, but that aside, the
AP4EVB board has board specific Kconfig bits and other stuff making it
difficult to fit into a single kernel binary. So I'd rather say good
bye to all this unless someone plans to fix it.

No, that was not the original idea. The first steps included code to
keep the tables in C.

Apparently. I made a prototype ages ago. Since then several people
have been requested to work on this, but unfortunately no useful
output has come from any of all this.

So Guennadi, if you want to keep this board then you have to step up
and fix things. If not then there is no point in keeping it.
