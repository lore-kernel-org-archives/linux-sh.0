This patch series adds clock management callbacks to the TMIO MMC driver,
fixes clock management on SDHI systems, updates clock frequency every time
the clock is re-enabled, adds regulator support to TMIO MMC and converts
the sh7724 ecovec system to use regulators with both MMCIF and SDHI/TMIO
controllers.

These patches continue my earlier series "mmc: sh_mmcif: add regulator
support," "mmc: sh-mmcif: clock management updates." The last patch in this
series also supersedes the earlier patch "[PATCH/RFC] sh: ecovec: switch
MMC power control to regulator."

I think, my clock management updates might cause some comments and require
some updates, so, I'm labelling this whole series as RFC too.

Guennadi Liakhovetski (7):
  mmc: tmio: stop interface clock before runtime PM suspending
  mmc: tmio: don't needlessly enable interrupts during probing
  mmc: tmio: add callbacks to enable-update and disable the interface
    clock
  mmc: sdhi: implement tmio-mmc clock enable-update and disable
    callbacks
  mmc: tmio: add regulator support
  mmc: sdhi: do not install dummy callbacks
  sh: ecovec: switch MMC power control to regulators
