I see. In this case the p0-p11 names match with the datasheet. Would
you prefer "port0" to match "Port 0" in the data sheet instead?

It is called  "jp0" or "JTAG Port 0" in the data sheet. It's a
read-only port for some pins associated with the JTAG connector.

Of course, it is possible to use gpio0 -> gpio12 but that is IMO more
difficult to use since those won't match with the data sheet or
schematics.

Thanks,
