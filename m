Wow, how hostile -- insult first, ask questions later?  I do review and
merge MMC patches; all it takes is a ping to let me know that the tmio
maintainer is absent and that you'd like me to start picking these up.
I'd seen them being taken into other trees, and no-one's asked me about
merging any of them into the MMC tree before, so I didn't realize there
was a problem.  We just need more communication.

So, let's come up with a workflow.  With Ian absent, it would be good to
have someone with TMIO hardware (I don't have any) who's willing to help
test and review/ACK patches.  I don't generally like to take arch code
in through the MMC tree, so it would also be good to break up some of
the patchsets into MMC-only if possible.
