This dependency is nothing new. Now all those drivers depend on shdma too, 
though, in a softer way - by using struct sh_dmae_slave. That struct is 
defined in include/linux/sh_dma.h and so we _could_ reuse it between 
several sh(-mobile) DMAC variants, but IIUC, there's currently no truly 
reliable way to make DMA slave drive drivers completely generic. And this 
will remain this way as long as DMA channel filtering is relying on an 
opaque argument, specific to each DMAC driver.

Russell has shown in a mail, how this hard dependency can be sort of 
eliminated by passing a string as a filter parameter. But then again - 
this _only_ works with drivers, that use this method. Similarly any non 
hardware-specific type could be used, e.g., an integer slave ID.

Moreover, I've been told explicitly, that exporting filter functions from 
respective DMAC drivers _is_ the correct way to use the current API...

Sure, that's what my DMA mux-driver idea [1] is aiming to achieve.
