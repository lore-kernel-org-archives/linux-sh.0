Here is a patch for shutting down the CPU0 to Power Off mode during
SUSPEND-to-RAM (in which case CPU1 is already shut down to Power Off mode
due to CPU hotplug).

While patch 2/2 implements this, we face some unresolved problems with the
interrupt controller code. See: "[PATCH] input: st1232: Add IRQF_NO_SUSPEND flag"
posted on 14th of February. This problem makes us unable to use the touchscreen
as a wakeup source. I consider patch 2/2 sane in itself though, and we
should consider merging it.

To test Suspend-to-RAM, patch 1/2 is supplied that is a workaround to the problem.

When I use the gpio keys in general (and as wakeup source), I get
------------[ cut here ]------------
WARNING: at drivers/tty/tty_buffer.c:428 flush_to_ldisc+0x44/0x1a0()
tty is NULL
I suppose this is another independent problem to this code.

Side note for future work: On the way to CPUIdle we might want to use
CPUIDLE_FLAG_COUPLED that enables us to coordinate the shutdown of both CPUs.

The patches are based on Simon's renesas/next branch.
