Yes, I believe the only reason this is x86 only is that each arch would
have to be tweaked separately. So a cleanup in _that_ regard would be
helpful. There is no real reason to have ptes accounted only for x86.
There might be some exceptions but well, our asm-generic allows to opt
in for generic implementation or override it with a special one. The
later should be an exception rather than the rule.
