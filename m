Just a general note about the use of the words exploit and exploitation.
In common usage, 'exploit' has become synonymous with 'misuse'.

Perhaps a better choice would be 'utilize' and 'utilization'?

The method to extend the sysfs interface for a specific device is in
linux-next. The original was proposed by Greg and reworked by
Yoshihiro YUNOMAE; see commit 266dcff03eed0050b6af11aaf2a61ab837d7ba3f,
'Serial: allow port drivers to have a default attribute group' and
commit aef9a7bd9b676f797dd5cefd43deb30d36b976a9,
'serial/uart/8250: Add tunable RX interrupt trigger I/F of FIFO buffers'
for how to use the default attribute group.

OTOH, I like your sysfs attribute name, rx_trigger_level, better than
the new 8250 attribute name, rx_trig_bytes. In one sense Greg was right;
the coming explosion of different device attributes with different handling
behavior is going to suck.

Regards,
Peter Hurley

On a side note: why is there so little locking in the sh-sci driver?
Is it uniprocessor?
