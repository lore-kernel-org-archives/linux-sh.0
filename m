SUPERH || ARCH_SHMOBILE covers all the platforms this driver currently builds 
on. Now that we're adding ARCH_SHMOBILE_MULTI the #if needs to cover that case 
as well. I'm fine with limiting the CTL_DMA_ENABLE write to SUPERH only (which 
would modify the driver's behaviour) or enabling it unconditionally, but I 
don't think adding a defined(CONFIG_ARCH_SHMOBILE_MULTI) to the above #if 
makes sense, unless there's a plan to add support for DMA for non-SH 
(including both SUPERH and ARCH_SHMOBILE) platforms.
