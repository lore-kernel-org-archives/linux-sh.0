        "... else we only get console messages on tty0, and because
        this DTS is shared between legacy and multi-platform."

That was needed at the time of commit 2c32622c3f3f9c7e ("ARM:
shmobile: armadillo800eva dts: Add chosen/stdout-path").

Due to generic DT/console updates later, the "console=" parameters were
no longer needed, cfr. commit 1403e38b829acdad ("ARM: dts: armadillo800eva:
Update console parameters").

I'm quite sure I do get console output on both ttyS0 and tty0 with the current
kernel (can't test right now due to board farm move/restructuring).

For a userspace prompt, I guess Phuc-san uses /dev/console as the console
device in e.g. /etc/inittab (or an equivalent)? If you want a prompt on tty0,
you better specify /dev/tty0 instead of /dev/console.

Gr{oetje,eeting}s,

                        Geert
