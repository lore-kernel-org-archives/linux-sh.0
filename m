I usually don't say things this loud, but here it is: NAK!

To begin with: this is not what we agreed on earlier. I asked you to
only implement a small subset to begin with. This so we don't end up
supporting a bunch of DT flags forever.

In general it's a good idea to make something generic, but I think now
is too early for our drivers on SH and SH-Mobile ARM. We need to
experiment more with PINCTRL as well as GPIO bindings via DT. When we
have done that I think we should revisit.

Please see below for my reasons:

I suspect that these overlap with PINCTRL. I don't want to add support
for potentially duplicated functionality.

We want to have stable DT bindings for GPIO and PINCTRL before we let
this loose with DT.

So please ignore this patch for now. Thanks for your efforts anyway.
