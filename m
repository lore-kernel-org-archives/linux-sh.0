Hi Iwamatsu-san,

Thanks for your efforts so far.

Uhm... No.

We want the same vector number here as described in the data sheet.
This looks like you're adding a software-defined base offset to the DT
data instead of using IRQ domains as expected. So it should read
<0x0700> which is the same as the VEU definition in the INTCS code in
intc-sh7372.c.

I recommend you to remove the INTCS support from these patches and
focus on INTCA only to begin with. Then later when you have corrected
INTCS tables and perhaps also the C code then it can be added
incrementally.

Please work on getting something small and simple merged.

Thanks,
