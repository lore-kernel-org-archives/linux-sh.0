	Hi Simon,

Here are a few updates for r8a7779/marzen CCF DT:
  - [1/2] ARM: shmobile: r8a7779 dtsi: Correct #address-cells/#size-cells
          for clocks
  - [2/2] ARM: shmobile: r8a7779 dtsi: Update unit-addresses for clocks

Compared to v1, the old "[2/2] ARM: shmobile: marzen dts: Remove
superfluous include" was dropped; a new "[2/2] ARM: shmobile: r8a7779 dtsi:
Update unit-addresses for clocks" was added.
More detailed change logs are included in the individual patches.

This was only compile-tested, due to lack of hardware.

Gr{oetje,eeting}s,

						Geert

when I'm talking to journalists I just say "programmer" or something like that.
