Right. Let's teach the KSZ8041 driver about that then :-)

That seems to me like the real issue we need to solve. The PHY clearly needs 
platform (or DT) data, so we need a way to pass it to the driver. Once we get 
that it shouldn't be difficult to add LED configuration information to the 
platform data.
