Sorry, too long after my morning coffee...
Yes, you're right, they won't be in mainline before v4.5-rc1.

When I noticed the problem, I didn't see the cause immediately, so I did a
bisect. Which didn't help much, as the problem only occurs when merging
l2-mtd/master...

Scrap, they can't go in first...

No, please don't delay it to 4.5.

But I'm afraid the for-next branches can't be fixed, as the DTS updates been in
arm-soc/for-next for a while. I don't think the arm-soc maintainers can be
bothered redoing all their merges, so we'll have to live with it...
