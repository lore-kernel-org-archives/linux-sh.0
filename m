The diffstat looks pretty tame to me - this could be merged via either
git-input or git-sh.  Probably the latter.

That would be a bad time to send it.  We should get patches into the
subsystem trees (and linux-next and -mm!) prior to the 2.6.x release.  A
subsystem maintainer who receives feature work during the 2.6.x merge
window could/shouidl/would schedule it for 2.6.x+1.
