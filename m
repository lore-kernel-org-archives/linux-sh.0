Sure, this is ugly. That's why this was an RFC.
I was mainly trying to trigger a reply from the GIC maintainers ;-)

That's indeed something I didn't take into account. Will change to just enabling
the clock from the clock driver.

That solution doesn't apply here, as we do have a correct description
of the hardware
in DT (after the other patches in the series, like e.g. (courtesy for
Lee) http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.linux.power-management.general/58123).

Thanks!
