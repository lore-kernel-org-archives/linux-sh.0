Hi!

The pm_domain is assuming that there is at most one powerdomain per
device, which is perfectly fine with my machines and the concept of
in-SoC powerdomains.

However, if so, wouldn't it be possible to simply set powerdomain by
setting a device's parent?
For example, for a device, struct device *dev, and a powerdomain,
struct device *pd, use
 "dev.parent = pd;", and let runtime-pm handle including the
"dev_power_governor" in the pm_domain's pm related code.


Cheers!
