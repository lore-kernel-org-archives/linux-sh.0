Actually, for those of you who care about details - NEC Electronics
and Renesas merged into Renesas Electronics. Other parts of NEC are
still around as usual.

That would be very interested to know. I've grepped the kernel tree
for existing code matching Uart, STI and GPIO but nothing so far. Does
anyone know where I can find docs for the MIPS based ones?

Good news is that documentation for Emma Mobile EV2 and Emma Mobile
1-S can be downloaded from renesas.com.
