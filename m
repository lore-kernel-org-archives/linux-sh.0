So, what? When we encounter such devices and decide that we actually
want a different driver for them (instead of enhancing the existing one)
we'll give them their own compatible string. It's not like "adi,adxl348"
will automatically match with "adi,adxl34x", is it?

Will it match anything else in the position other than 1st (i.e.
if device has compatible sting like "adi,adxl345-1", "adi,adxl345")?
Why "adi,adxl34x" is special?

Thanks.
