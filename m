Yes, I agree that having a shared file would be the best solution.
Unfortunately with the current preboot architecture and infra structure,
it would not be a trivial task. I believe defining these functions for
each arch would give a better code modularity compared to including them
in the decompressor file.

We could do that.  But according to the comment in the original
implementation, there seems to be a concern regarding its performance
speed. If you believe all archs' memcpy would give comparable
performance to the memmove. then I could do that.

For x86, I think I could move memmove to the misc.c file and put an
ifdef XZ_PREBOOT around it.  This way it should not impact other
decompressor.  I could also do this for s390 and sh.  But if we decide
to replace memmove with memcpy this would be necessart.

Thank you very for your comment.  Please let me know what you think.
I'll redo and send out a new patch.  Thanks in advance.

Thanks,
Mak.
