I don't think we disagree is. The problem with the TMIO driver is that it 
entered after runtime suspend a code path that should not be entered. When the 
driver is notified by the MMC core that access to the card is not needed 
anymore, it correctly signal to the runtime PM core that the device can be 
suspended, but then tried to setup the device nonetheless. There's no point in 
setting up the device after we get told that we don't need it anymore, it will 
be setup when resumed anyway. That's the code path that was wrong, and is 
fixed by my patch.
