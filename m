Well not completely, as it increases the reference count.  The advantage
would be that clk_enable counts addionally as prepare, so it would be
impossible to unprepare an enabled clock.  And the other way round an
unprepared clock would never be enabled.

Well, with my suggestion it's atomic when certain precondions are given.
IMHO that's better than "atomic in most cases" because the caller can
assert that everything goes smooth.
These preconditions are asserted when the driver writer is careful
enough to stick to the API.

Either my idea is bad or I'm unable to sell it appropriately.  Be it as
it is, I will stop to make a case for it.

Best regards and thanks for your try,
Uwe
