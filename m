According to the datasheet there are two register sets sharing the same base 
address, banked through secure mode. There's additionally an alias at a 
different base address for non-secure registers access when running in secure 
mode. The hardware description thus depends on whether we're running in secure 
or non-secure mode, which doesn't play nicely with DT.

Additionally, I've tried to disable secure mode at boot time to test non-
secure mode at the base address, but it didn't seem to make any difference. I 
might have done something wrong though.

For these reasons I don't really like the idea of having two resources for 
secure and non-secure mode. Extending the single resource to cover the base 
address and the aliases should be fine though, I'll give it a go.

Agreed, I'll do that.
