I agree, I don't really want to see more callbacks either.

Yes, but note that you list 2 RPM_SUSPENDED states, but there is only
one .runtime_suspend callback, so the driver is only be notified of one
of the them.

More specifically, the problem is that using generic PM domains, there
are no callbacks to the driver for "device stopped", since the driver's
.runtime_suspend() is not called until "device power off."

What I tried to say in my initial reply is that many devices actually
have device specific stuff to do in preparation for "device stopped", or
the hardware will not actually reach the targetted power state.  Without
a callback, no device-specific preparation for "device stopped" can be
done.

thinking out loud: hmm..., the more I think of this, maybe we should
actually be using RPM_IDLE to represent your definition of "device
stopped."

Unfortunately, PM on embedded devices is very fine grained and very
complicated.
