Hi Geert,

Thank you for the patches.

For patches 3-6, 13, 15-16 and 22 and 24,

I'm not sure I'd bother with patch 25/25, but I'm not against merging it 
either. I'd be surprised if the serial driver still worked at all on SH :-)

Could you briefly explain (and even better in a source code comment) how you 
handle baud rate calculation with the chained BRGs ?
