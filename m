I see your description and example includes I/O regions, but the driver
claims in a comment that these don't work. Do you also have a patch to
make them work?

In case that patch is part of the 9-patch series, do you mind adding the
arm kernel mailing list (and maybe me personally) to Cc the next time?

I'm curious about why there are two non-prefetchable regions. What is
the significance of this?

Are you sure that there is only one legacy interrupt?  Most host
controllers wire up IntA through IntD to different output pins.

Otherwise looks good.
