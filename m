This patch series enables DMA support for QSPI on r8a7791/koelsch legacy.
It's independent from the series "ARM: shmobile: koelsch reference: Enable
DMA for QSPI".

[2/4] was written by Morimoto-san for LTSI 3.10, and forward ported by me.

This was tested on r8a7791/koelsch.

Performance figures for reading from a QSPI FLASH driven at 24.375 MHz are:
  - Single:  1.1 Mbps PIO, 23 Mbps DMA
  - Dual  : 12.7 Mbps PIO, 48 Mbps DMA
  - Quad  : 13   Mbps PIO, 70 Mbps DMA

Thanks for your comments!

  [2/4] ARM: shmobile: r8a7791: Add SYS-DMAC support
  [3/4] ARM: shmobile: r8a7791: Add QSPI DMA support
  [4/4] ARM: shmobile: koelsch legacy: Enable DMA for QSPI

In personal conversations with technical people, I call myself a hacker. But
when I'm talking to journalists I just say "programmer" or something like that.
