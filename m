Correct. I've implemented that in patch 9/9. Note that the patch also frees 
pages use for page directory entries when they're not needed anymore, instead 
of just marking them as invalid. That's something you probably should do in 
the arm-smmu driver as well.

I haven't checked all the other IOMMU drivers, but at least the OMAP IOMMU 
driver relies on the same assumption. Splitting map/unmap operations in page 
size chunks inside the IOMMU core might indeed have a negative performance 
impact due to locking, but I'm not sure it would be noticeable.
