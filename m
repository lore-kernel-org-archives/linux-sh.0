Hi Sergei,

Thanks for your efforts with this SATA driver.

Well, I have to agree with Morimoto-san here. Other vendors may chose
to use AUXDATA to map clocks, and I believe it makes sense in the case
of adding platform data as a workaround during transition to full DT
support. But for simply mapping clocks please follow the same style as
we have done so far, which is what Morimoto-san pointed out:

CLKDEV_DEV_ID("fc600000.sata_rcar", &mstp_clks[MSTP115]),

Also, I don't think SATA is needed as an early device so it should be
enough to register it late as a regular platform device. =)

Thanks,
