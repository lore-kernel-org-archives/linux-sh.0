Ok, got it, thanks for the explanation!

Yes, that makes sense.

Just for completeness, am I guessing right that cases 2-4 are only for
the previous "Renesas Technology" chips and their suggessors, while
the previous NEC Emma EV2 only does the regular zImage boot?
What about the current "Renesas Electronics" parts that include NEC
technology, do they all support the head-shmobile.S direct boot?
