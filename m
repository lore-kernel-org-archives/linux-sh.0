But there is a difference to 'one function to rule both sleepable and
atomic clocks'.  When calling _atomic on a sleepable clock you get
-ESOMETHING back (and the clock stays off).  With a generic clk_enable
you get an oops and so cannot handle the error.

IMHO this is not right.  If the driver developer doesn't care if the
clock sleeps or not (which is the norm I think) he calls the _sleepable
function and if the clock happen to be an atomic one it doesn't hurt
him.

And looking at the usage of the sleeping functions in the gpio API, I'd
bet that at least 50% of the calls to gpio_set_value can/should be
gpio_set_value_cansleep.  That's because driver developers don't care or
are not aware of the issue.  If it would be gpio_set_value
vs.gpio_set_value_atomic most developers would use the sleeping variant
and the few that should use the _atomic function would notice that when
seeing the corresponding oops.

Best regards
Uwe
