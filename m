Ok, thanks. I'd like to go through them myself if possible. I was
looking for a cover letter or something that listed the patches but I
can't seem to find it. Can you please provide a list?

Can you please define "boot with fdt"? As you probably know, both
board-lager.c and board-lager-reference.c boot with DT. I suppose you
mean that you want DT to describe the entire system, with no C code
for the board? Please note that some devices like timers still don't
use DT, so if you can live without those then... =)

Thanks,
