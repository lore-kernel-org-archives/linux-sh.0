Thanks a lot! Making this clear and consistent was on my todo-list,
unfortunately below some other items.

Both drivers have quite orthogonal slave_irq routines. What do you think
about grouping this and the reg/unreg-calls together and compile them
conditionally on I2C_SLAVE? I think the code savings are worth it.
