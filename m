Subject: [PATCH 0/2] fbdev: sh_mobile_lcdc: YUV framebuffer support

These patches add support for 12, 16, and 24 bit YUV framebuffers.

These patches are a reworking of an earlier submitted patch 
"Add NV12 input framebuffer support" to include the two other modes.

Additionally updated are:

* Y and C plane ordering.  When double-buffering both Y planes appear before
  the C planes (Y-Y-C-C), instead of Y-C-Y-C.  
* In YUV 420 mode, panning is only possible in 2 line increments
* Additionally in YUV 420 mode the value of yres must be set to an even number
* The value of .nonstd in struct sh_mobile_lcdc_chan_cfg from the platform data is
  exposed to applications via the .nonstd element of struct fb_var_screeninfo.
  Additionally this value is written to bits 16-31 of LDDFR in the LCDC.
* Chip dependent flags for the bits of LDDFR greater that bit 17 are defined
* Add a userspace include file <linux/sh_mobile_fb.h> as a place to hold defines
  and future ioctl definitions.
