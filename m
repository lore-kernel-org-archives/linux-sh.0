This pull request has conflicts with renesas-soc-for-v3.12, which I also
sent a pull request for earlier today. I have a provided an example
resolution as part of the renesas-devel-20130724v2 tag in the renesas tree.

In words: take both sides.

The conflicting files are:
	arch/arm/boot/dts/r8a73a4.dtsi
	arch/arm/boot/dts/r8a7790.dtsi
