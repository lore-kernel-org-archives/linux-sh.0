Pulled.

By the way, the dependencies above are probably better described in
the email than in the tag, since there's a good chance your branches
will be gone from kernel.org by the time someone reads the changelog;
i.e. it doesn't really provide useful information for the changelog. It's very
useful for us though so please continue to provide it.
