Hi Ben,

(dropping netdev and davem, adding Felipe, Kevin, linux-pm, and
linux-arm-kernel)

Yes, that's also my understanding.

Commit 4d27e9dcff00a6425d779b065ec8892e4f391661 ("PM: Make
power domain callbacks take precedence over subsystem ones") explains
the rationale behind this.

Now, this doesn't prevent your power domain from delegating to other
callbacks...

If the power domain just calls pm_generic_runtime_suspend(), it will only
consider the driver-specific callback, bypassing type, class, and
bus-specific callbacks.

So should the power domain delegate it further using a similar ladder
strategy like RPM_GET_CALLBACK() at the core pm level, i.e.
try type/class/bus/driver?
And type should delegate to class/bus/driver, class to bus/driver, bus to
driver?

The code indeed looks a bit like a mix of:
  - Lack of callback means it's safe to suspend,
  - Lack of callback means it's not safe to suspend.

BTW, I also looked a bit into history, and added asterisks in front of the
most interesting parts:

 1. drivers/sh/pm_runtime.c
    Initial version by Magnus, reworked by Rafael

 2. This approach was applied to omap1, "to allow code sharing with shmobile",
    in commit 600b776eb39a13a28b090ba9efceb0c69d4508aa
    ("OMAP1 / PM: Use generic clock manipulation routines for runtime PM")
    by Rafael, acked-by Kevin Hilman.
*   This one is interesting, as it moves omap1 away from the
*   fck/ick-centric approach Felipe proposed to generalize in
*   https://lkml.org/lkml/2014/1/31/290

 3. Kevin converted omap2 in commit
    commit 638080c37ae08fd0c44cec13d7948ca5385ae851 ("OMAP2+ / PM: move
    runtime PM implementation to use device power domains")
*   and fixed it for power domain callbacks taking precedence in commit
*   345f79b3de7f6d651e4dba794af7c7303bdfd649 ("OMAP: PM: omap_device: fix
*   device power domain callbacks").
*   This is what Ben is proposing to add to drivers/sh/pm_runtime.c.

 4. Kevin converted davinci in commit
    ce9dcb8784611c50974d1c6b600c71f5c0a29308 ("ARM: davinci: add runtime PM
    support for clock management").

 5. which got copied by Santosh Shilimkar for keystone in commit
    fc20ffe1213beb09bb7fb6687b404fe48183a55e ("ARM: keystone: add PM domain
    support for clock management").

Gr{oetje,eeting}s,

                        Geert
