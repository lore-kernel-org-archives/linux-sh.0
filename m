We have memblocks, memory_blocks  ... I guess memory_block_device is
unique :)

Especially, I suspect a lot of bugs in the area of

1. Remove memory that has never been onlined
2. Remove memory that has been onlined/offlined a couple of times
3. Remove memory that has been onlined to different zones.

Will see when refactoring if my intuition is right :)
