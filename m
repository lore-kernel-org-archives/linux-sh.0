This was my original question - I'm not aware of any reason why you
should need to register the driver for the specific bus first, it seems
odd.

It's the most common bus for PMICs but some use SPI for performance
reasons, especially if they integrate other mixed signal functionality
such as touchscreen controllers that might be high volume.

That's not a general solution as it doesn't cover things like cross
dependencies between devices on the same bus type.  You really want to
be able to say "I depend on this set of other devices" somehow, the
proposal from Grant that I'm talking about was to only register devices
once their dependencies had appeared which solves the issue but is a bit
manual for the board files.
