Missing L2 cache flushes for (any) the secondary core data/trampoline?

That sounds bad:

start_kernel() -> rest_init() -> kernel_thread(kernel_init)

kernel_init() -> kernel_init_freeable() -> smp_init() -> (for each CPU) cpu_up()

By the time we get to rest_init(), init_IRQ(), time_init(),
local_irq_enable(), late_time_init(), calibrate_delay(), etc have all
been called, so if jiffies is not incrementing in __cpu_up(), that's
a big problem.
