Hi

Another round of SH-HDMI improvements. Tests showed, that the best result 
is achieved with the 720p format on HDMI, to override that users are given 
a possibility to use the "video=sh_mobile_lcdc:..." kernel command line to 
specified a preferred video-mode.

Paul, since one of the patches touches the ap4evb board, it's better to 
push this via genesis.

Thanks
Guennadi
