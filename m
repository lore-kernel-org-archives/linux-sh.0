mipi_display.h sounds good to me.

I wouldn't invent a new word for this =). The DSI spec talks about
commands, data types and transactions, I think we should pick one of
them.

Perhaps this is already approaching nitpicking, but:

As only some of the commands/datatypes/transactions are commands, I
think that's not proper word. All of them have a data type number, and I
guess they all are transactions. So "Turn On Peripheral Command" is a
transaction, and its data type is 0x32.

I guess if the enum is named, it should then be mipi_dsi_transaction.

But then, which one of these would be more correct:

dsi_send(enum mipi_dsi_transaction transaction)
dsi_send(u8 datatype)

As I said previously, I haven't seen any panel using custom datatypes,
but I wouldn't be surprised if some panel does. In that sense I would go
for using u8, and then perhaps leaving the enum unnamed.

What do you think?

Sounds good.

Yep, I think that's the only change for now.

This is something I've been thinking about for some time. I even made
some prototypes for it, but I didn't have time to go forward with it.

It would of course be nice to use the same panel driver on different
boards, so I think this is definitely something to think about in the
future.
