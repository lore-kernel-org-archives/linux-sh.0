I understand. Unfortunately the nature of patche series such as this is
that they require the whole series to be applied atomically (or at least
in a very specific order). So the patch that uses the new enable_gpio
field can only be applied after all previous patches. The only
reasonable way to ensure that is to take all of the patches through one
tree. Furthermore this patch is tiny (it adds a single line) and touches
code that's unlikely to be modified by anyone else.

But if it makes you more comfortable, I could provide a stable branch
that contains this series for you to merge into the shmobile tree. That
should enable you to handle all conflict resolution prior to submitting
to arm-soc.
