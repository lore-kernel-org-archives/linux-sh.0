I think you can do at least some of this without committing to bindings all
that early. Keep in mind that bindings can be amended over time, so if you
start a driver with a trivial binding you can add properties over time as
needed.

I think some of this could be easier to discuss if you include one or two
examples of the more complex drivers that you need to tackle.

Using AUXDATA to attach platform data is easy to do but messy to undo, since it
tends to require interlocked changes with the driver trees, which means shared
branches and merge conflicts across the wider tree. It has been done before
though so it's not impossible. :-)

Again, I think it might be beneficial to talk about one or two specific
examples here instead of the generic situation, and figure it out from there.
