Hi Kevin, Hi Olof, Hi Arnd,

please consider this fourth round of Renesas ARM based SoC cleanups for v3.12.

It is based on renesas-cleanup3-for-v3.12 ("Third round of ARM based SoC SMP updates for v3.12") which you have previously pulled.

I apologise that this and other pull requests that I will send today
are rather later in the cycle than I would like. This is primarily due
to a combination of my summer vacation and wanting to let the patches
sit in next for a while.


The following changes since commit 282b583f752f996ee5c33b0cdc18adf3b5094ee0:

  ARM: shmobile: sh73a0: Remove global GPIO_NR definition (2013-08-06 18:07:13 +0900)

are available in the git repository at:
