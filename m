Yes, it seems that a lot of the lager drivers assume that this support
is there, and the work seems to have been sponsored by Renesas.

I think there must be people still building the old style of kernel
as there is still work going on for board-lager.c which leads me to
being a bit surprised that no-one had noticed this (as it isn't as
if it produces a pile of warnings on the console output).
