Your assumption is wrong. The aforementioned patch is always needed in
the multi-platform case.

Please let me clarify:
drivers/sh/pm_runtime.c registers a bus notifier for platform devices, which
registers the default clock for automatic clock management by the PM core.
If CONFIG_PM_RUNTIME=y, the clock will be managed dynamically, based
on runtime requirements.
If CONFIG_PM_RUNTIME=n, the clock will be enabled at registration time.

So even if CONFIG_PM_RUNTIME=n, you need this patch, else the affected
clocks won't be enabled (if not already enabled by reset state or the boot
loader).

Note that some drivers (e.g. sh-sci) will still work fine without
drivers/sh/pm_runtime.c, as they manage their clocks themselves.

Gr{oetje,eeting}s,
