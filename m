I'm running into similar spurious interrupt issues on both kzm9g-reference and 
marzen-reference. Magnus, you've rejected this patch, how would you like the 
issue to be fixed ? Could you please provide a patch ? This is blocking 
pinctrl DT testing, as I can't get any board to boot properly through DT with 
ethernet support.
