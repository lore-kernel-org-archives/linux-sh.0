Hello Stephen,

Thanks for your suggestion. Yes, there was indeed some confusion. Now
after diving into the code a bit deeper I can finally understand what
you mean.

Instead of adjusting the rating I've changed the cpumask member like this:

--- 0001/drivers/clocksource/em_sti.c
+++ work/drivers/clocksource/em_sti.c    2013-08-29 17:33:16.000000000 +0900
@@ -301,7 +301,7 @@ static void em_sti_register_clockevent(s
     ced->name = dev_name(&p->pdev->dev);
     ced->features = CLOCK_EVT_FEAT_ONESHOT;
     ced->rating = 200;
-    ced->cpumask = cpumask_of(0);
+    ced->cpumask = cpu_all_mask;
     ced->set_next_event = em_sti_clock_event_next;
     ced->set_mode = em_sti_clock_event_mode;

Without the cpumask fix or without the earlier rating fix the
following interrupt count can be seen in /proc/interrupts on KZM9D:

157:        140          0       GIC 157  e0180000.sti
160:          0          0  e0050000.gpio   1  eth0
IPI0:          0          0  CPU wakeup interrupts
IPI1:          0          0  Timer broadcast interrupts

Above, notice how no IPI1 interrupts seem to be arriving.

With the cpumask fix above the interrupt count becomes like this:

 157:        559          0       GIC 157  e0180000.sti
160:          0          0  e0050000.gpio   1  eth0
IPI0:          0          0  CPU wakeup interrupts
IPI1:          0        601  Timer broadcast interrupts

Would this be in line with your expectation?

Thanks,
