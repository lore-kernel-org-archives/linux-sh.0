I trust you on this, it's not for me to decide but for the ARM SoC
maintainers. I think Arnd basically said at one point that it is OK
to add some new cruft as long as you remove more old cruft at
the same time, so I guess you will have to make an argument that
this is happening.

This is pretty much the inverse argument of the usual stance of
the ARM SoC tree - usually we ask that new platforms should use
new frameworks. I do understand it from a practical point of view,
that new SoCs only exist in few prototypes.

But again, this is up for the ARM SoC folks to decide.
