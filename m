I think it would be a good start, and I'll ask others to do the same
in the future/

Good point. My feeling is that the bloat we get in the kernel image
when everything is built-in weighs more though.

It's currently impossible to run allmodconfig on real hardware, there
are a couple of options that prevent you from doing this.

allyesconfig cannot currently be built even, mostly due to bad interaction
of the way we link the kernel with how the linker is implemented: we
get lots of failed relocations for cross-section calls larger than
32MB away.
