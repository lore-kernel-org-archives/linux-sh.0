We could, I guess. For the moment I'd prefer to point out that these are
MMIO registers :)

Ok. If the binding just covers the muxed interrupt for now that's fine.
We can add interrupt-names later when we support multiple interrupts
(and fall back to assuming muxed when no interrupt-names property is
present).

It would certainly be nice to have a standard way of doing just that.
I'd hope that with the schema work going on that would fall into place
automatically, so perhaps it's not worth doing now.

I don't expect the format of clocks and the relationship to clock-names
to change, so "must" is likely more appropriate. I'm just too used to
writing "should"...

Yes, that sounds much better.

Cheers,
