Ok, thanks. I have also posted a patch now for the jz4740 platform
that is the other user of slave_id.

Fair enough.

Patch 8 looks great to me.

Patch 9 as I mentioned is a bit strange because it duplicates the some
of the data between tmio_mmc_data and tmio_mmc_dma, which are both
visible to the tmio_mmc_dma.c file. Simply folding tmio_mmc_dma into
tmio_mmc_data seems like the simplest solution to that.
