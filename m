Yes it does.

Hence please merge both the dependency and this series.

  1. Both sh73a0/kzm9g-multiplatform and r8a73a4/ape6evm-multiplatform
      depend on "[PATCH v3 0/4] drivers: bus: Add Simple Power-Managed Bus",
  2. DT PM domain for sh73a0 and r8a73a4 depends on
      sh73a0/kzm9g-multiplatform and r8a73a4/ape6evm-multiplatform,
  3. CONFIG_CPU_IDLE=y hangs on sh73a0 without an early timer.
       - On kzm9g-multiplatform this can be fixed by adding an
         arm,cortex-a9-twd-timer node, but that breaks kzm9g-reference as
         the TWD driver requires CCF when instantiated from DT,
       - Fixing this on kzm9g-reference requires setting
         ".init_time = sh73a0_earlytimer_init", and also instantiating the GIC
         from C board code, as the TWD platform device uses an hardcoded
         interrupt number.
         It seems simpler to let kzm9g-reference die, so this problem goes
         away.

Thanks for your consideration!

Gr{oetje,eeting}s,

                        Geert
