I think you misunderstood the requirement. All other configuration,
i.e. slave port address, burst size, bus width, really should be
configured using dmaengine_slave_config, since this is data that
is known by the /driver/, independent of the DMA engine in use and
unknown to the platform. The request line number is something that
the driver cannot know, since it is a property of the DMA engine.

In a lot of cases you actually need more than one number here, e.g.
to configure which master port of the DMA engine is being used.
That's why the dmaengine DT binding needs a variable #dma-cells
property that is specific to the dma engine being used.
