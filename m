Are those two list macro changes what you refer to as "a lot?" ;-) You're 
right in principle, they are not directly related to the purpose of this 
patch, they are just something that occurred to me, while tracking down 
DMA packets. But yes, it can be extracted to a separate cosmetic patch...

From a first glance these tasklets are not directly enough related to 
IRQs, so, doing that is either impossible, or would require a _much_ 
deeper change to the driver and _this_ would indeed be a much bigger 
change than just fixing the Oops.
