Hi Ian,

Thanks for your email. I'm glad to hear that you have no objections to
this patch series.

Regarding PXA DMA, without knowing the PXA DMA hardware that well
(never recall using DMA on that platform), from a code reuse point of
view it would be absolutely best to share the DMA Engine interface in
the tmio mmc driver with the SDHI. But I'm not sure if any DMA Engine
driver exists for the PXA though.

Thanks,
