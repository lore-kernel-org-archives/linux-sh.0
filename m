Hi Paul, Mike
thanks for your feedback.

I agree with you that the Kconfig and Makefile changes are not arch
specific, so these changes can be moved to a common code (even if I
don't know if other archs do support SSP).
In the current kernel, only x86 and ARM added this support, so I'm
wondering if, moving SSP to the common Makefile, it needs to depend on
x86, ARM, SH being configured ?

Regarding the __stack_chk_guard symbol defined in process[_32].c, I
don't know if all archs need to define this global variable to implement
SSP. For sure x86 does not need it. It depends on how the gcc implements
this feature. This was mainly the reason for which we defined it
specifically in an arch specific code.

What is your opinion ?

Thanks,
Carmelo & Filippo
