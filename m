Hello,

This patch series replaces all numerical IRQ types by the corresponding
IRQ_TYPE_* macros in device tree sources. It starts by switching from
/include/ to #include (1/7), replacing numerical types by macros in SoC DT
files (2/7) and board DT files (3/7), and fixing several boards that use a
defined IRQ type instead of IRQ_TYPE_NONE.

The changes have been tested on the armadillo and marzen boards.

Laurent Pinchart (7):
  ARM: shmobile: Use #include in device tree sources
  ARM: shmobile: Use interrupt macros in SoC DT files
  ARM: shmobile: Use interrupt macros in board DT files
  ARM: shmobile: marzen-reference: Use falling edge IRQ for LAN9221
  ARM: shmobile: bockw-reference: Use falling edge IRQ for LAN9221
  ARM: shmobile: kzm9g-reference: Use falling edge IRQ for LAN9221
  ARM: shmobile: armadillo-reference: Use low level IRQ for ST1231
