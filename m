It can work, the spear platforms have recently been converted from
no DT support at all to completely being DT based, and the cortex-a9
based spear13xx platform that was added now was DT-only from the
start.

ok, I see.

Yes, that looks all good.

It also came up in the discussion about making multiplatform kernels
DT-only, where someone asked about the same thing. So now that Grant
has clarified that it's actually what we plan to do anyway, I guess
you could start working on it if you're interested.
