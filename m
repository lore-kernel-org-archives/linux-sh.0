Indeed. Note that I only try to preserve the register value before and after
migrating to generic l2c OF initialization. I did read (part of) the pl310
documentation, but it's still not clear to me if we really need
L2C_AUX_CTRL_SHARED_OVERRIDE. Perhaps this was just copied from
somewhere else without much afterthought?
