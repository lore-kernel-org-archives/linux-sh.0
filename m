Firstly, I would like an Ack from Magnus on the shmobile patches.

With regards to merge order, my preference is to merge patches
in parallel once their dependencies will no longer change.

So for this series it lools like.

5/9: Can be merged independently of other patches in the series.
     But there isn't much point in merging it until the rest of the
     series is acked and tested.
6-9/9: Needs to wait until 4/9 has at least been acked by Mark
       Also, is 1/9 a run-time dependency of these changes?
