Am I right in thinking that with this change in place we need the following
change to the defconfig in order for it to compile.

diff --git a/arch/arm/configs/kzm9d_defconfig b/arch/arm/configs/kzm9d_defconfig

I am holding off on pushing the patches I queued up today until
this can be resolved one way or another.
