+*NOTE* on CD and WP polarity. To use common for all SD/MMC host controllers line
+polarity properties, we have to fix the meaning of the "normal" and "inverted"
+line levels. We choose to follow the SDHCI standard, which specifies both those
+lines as "active low." Therefore, using the "cd-inverted" property means, that
+the CD line is active high, i.e. it is high, when a card is inserted. Similar
+logic applies to the "wp-inverted" property.
+
+CD and WP lines can be implemented on the hardware in one of two ways: as GPIOs,
+specified in cd-gpios and wp-gpios properties, or as dedicated pins. Polarity of
+dedicated pins can be specified, using *-inverted properties. GPIO polarity can
+also be specified using the OF_GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW flag. This creates an ambiguity
+in the latter case. We choose to use the XOR logic for GPIO CD and WP lines.
+This means, the two properties are "superimposed," for example leaving the
+OF_GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW flag clear and specifying the respective *-inverted
+property results in a double-inversion and actually means the "normal" line
+polarity is in effect.
+
 Optional SDIO properties:
 - keep-power-in-suspend: Preserves card power during a suspend/resume cycle
 - enable-sdio-wakeup: Enables wake up of host system on SDIO IRQ assertion
