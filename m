I think this was bought up sometime back and we have cleared that all
_prep functions can be invoked in atomic context.

This is the reason why we have been pushing folks to use GFP_NOWAIT is
memory allocations during prepare.

Thanks for pointing out documentation doesn't say so, will send a patch for
that.

On issue_pending and tx_submit, yes these should be allowed to be called
from atomic context too.

Lastly, just to clarify the callback invoked after descriptor is complete
can also be used to submit new descriptors, so folks are dropping locking
before invoking the callback
