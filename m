Seems reasonable.

The operation of this function was presumably obvious to you at the
time you wrote it, but that isn't true of other people at later times.

Please document it?

hm, well.  Who said that this function will only ever be called
after that CPU was taken down?  There is nothing in the function name
nor in the (absent) documentation which enforces this precondition.

If someone tries to use this function for a different purpose, or
copies-and-modifies it for a different purpose, we just shot them in
the foot.

They'd be pretty dumb to do that without reading the local comment,
but still...

It is good that this code exists under CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU.  Did you
check that everything works correctly with CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU=n?
