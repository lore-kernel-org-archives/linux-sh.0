Hi Simon,

Thank you for the patch.

I would define a single HSPI clock and reference it from the three HSPI 
instances. Having three identical copies of a single clock will not work, the 
first clock to be disabled will disable the other two as they would all share 
the same register bit. Don't forget to remove two of the three CLK_S 
references above.

Bad copy and paste ? This should be TMU2, TMU1 and TMU0.

> +				R8A7779_CLK_HSCIF0 R8A7779_CLK_HSCIF0

HSCIF1 and HSCIF0 ?

Following the comments above, this should become

"hspi", "tmu2", "tmu1", "tmu0".

Same as above, two instances of the same hardware clock won't fly.

Same here.

Following the comments above, this would become "usb01", "usb2".
