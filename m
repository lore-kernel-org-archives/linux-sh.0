This series moves the r7s72100 platfrom from the legacy clock implementation to
the common clock framework. Only the essential clocks are added in this series,
and other clocks will be added incrementally once the basic stuff is accepted.

This series has been tested with the renesas-devel-v3.14-rc4-20140227 tag. It
has a build dependency [1] because it uses the clkdev workaround. If you want
to boot into a console, you also have a runtime dependency [2]. A git branch
can be found here:
