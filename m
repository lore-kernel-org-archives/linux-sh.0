    Yes, it does.

    They are enough as BT.656 interconnect is used between VIN1 and ADV7180.

    The HS and VS/FIELD pins of ADV7180 are left unconnected.  There's also 
ADV7612 connected to VIN0 on this board, there the HSYNC and VSYNC/FIELD pins 
are connected; however, ADV7612 is not supported yet.
