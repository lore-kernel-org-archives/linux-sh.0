Thanks.  I wonder what's different about your ntpdate that triggers
this, and why all my iMX6 behave fine, which have desktop-like ubuntu
installs on (of two different versions.)

What it's basically showing is that (unsurprisingly)
csum_partial_copy_from_user is trying to access userspace.  I'll see
about fixing that today, or pulling the patch from -next if I can't.

I've also noticed that on rpc_defconfig, the 0-day builder shows that
this triggers an ICE as the compiler appears to think it's run out of
registers.

Yes, this one is because I forgot to provide the non-protected default
for bootup, which I've already merged a fix for.
