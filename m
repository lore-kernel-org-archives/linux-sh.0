At this point we make use of capability flags prefixed with TMIO_MMC
to flag that the specific hardware block supports a certain feature.
So for instance the SDIO code for tmio-mmc is rather isolated and is
only enabled if TMIO_MMC_SDIO_IRQ is flagged - like it is by the SDHI
mfd wrapper.

Like Paul mentioned, upcoming Runtime PM changes will be very
intrusive, so the current abstraction may not be enough in the near
future. But let's deal with that then.

As for SDHI documentation, we have access to very little information.
The SDHI blocks are not even included in the regular per-SoC data
sheet. I managed to figure out that we can use the tmio-mmc driver by
comparing bit fields in an out-of-tree driver with existing mainline
drivers.

I suspect that the SDHI hardware block is somewhat related to the
MN57xx family, perhaps, MN5774. For not so much information in
japanese google for "2002_co2.pdf mn57xx". According to that
information there are a wide range of devices available but we're yet
to see any open driver coming from the vendor. At this point all we've
got is the tmio-mmc driver that has been reverse engineered by
hobbyists.

Many thanks for your help!
