Hm, your channel assignment above seems a tad different from what I believe:

MSTP016 is for channel 0..n of TMU0
MSTP015 is for channel 0..n of TMU1
MSTP014 is for channel 0..n of TMU2

Actually, you can check how the TMU channels are bundled together
based on the I/O memory and interrupts.
The TMU driver configuration in setup-sh73a0 contains these:

static struct sh_timer_config tmu00_platform_data = {
	.name = "TMU00",
	.channel_offset = 0x4,
	.timer_bit = 0,
	.clockevent_rating = 200,
};

static struct resource tmu00_resources[] = {
	[0] = {
		.name	= "TMU00",
		.start	= 0xfff60008,
		.end	= 0xfff60013,
		.flags	= IORESOURCE_MEM,
	},
	[1] = {
		.start	= intcs_evt2irq(0x0e80), /* TMU0_TUNI00 */
		.flags	= IORESOURCE_IRQ,
	},
};

and

static struct sh_timer_config tmu01_platform_data = {
	.name = "TMU01",
	.channel_offset = 0x10,
	.timer_bit = 1,
	.clocksource_rating = 200,
};

static struct resource tmu01_resources[] = {
	[0] = {
		.name	= "TMU01",
		.start	= 0xfff60014,
		.end	= 0xfff6001f,
		.flags	= IORESOURCE_MEM,
	},
	[1] = {
		.start	= intcs_evt2irq(0x0ea0), /* TMU0_TUNI01 */
		.flags	= IORESOURCE_IRQ,
	},
};

Note how the IORESOURCE_MEM ranges for tmu00 and tmu01 are closely
located. Also check the channel_offset platform data that point out
the shared start-stop register. The timer bit is the per-channel
start-stop bit. Another hint is in the IORESOURCE_IRQ and the
TMU0_TUNI00 + TMU0_TUNI01 comments that both start with TMU0_.

So basically, in this case both tmu00 and tmu01 should be assigned to
MSTP016 aka TMU00.

This line must be correct from my point of view:

CLKDEV_DEV_ID("sh_tmu.1", &mstp_clks[MSTP016]), /* TMU00 */
