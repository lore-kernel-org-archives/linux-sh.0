Hi,

these are v2 patches which add sound support to the r8a7795/Salvator-X.

These patches are an update of Simon's v5 patch-set

The main change to the patches themselves since Morimoto-san's v3 posting
and v4 updates to that posting is to update to new CPG/MSSR bindings via
Geert Uytterhoeven.

It doesn't include cs2000 support since it is not accepted yet.
I will send additional patch if it was accepted.
This patches doesn't include CTU/MIX support either,
because it is too advanced feature at this point.

Base:

* "[PATCH v4 0/3] arm64: renesas: r8a7795: add I2C support"
  This can be found in the topic/r8a7795-i2c-v4 branch of
  my renesas tree on kernel.org.
