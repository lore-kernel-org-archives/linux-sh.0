Hmm, I think I tried at one time to install Debian on an iMX6 platform
and gave up with it after spending 50 minutes with the installer getting
so far, and then killing the network - it was very repeatable, and always
happened at the same point in the installation.  I gave up with Debian
at that point, as I didn't have lots of 50 minutes to babysit the silly
installer (which can't ask the questions up-front) nor did I want to
waste my monthly internet allowance on multiple failed install attempts.

The reports I was getting from other iMX6 users was that Debian Jessie
had lots of problems at that time.

Hmm.

So, the question I need to find an answer to is... why hasn't this path
been exercised on my platforms during my testing.  It's certainly
compiled into the kernel...

Anyway, I've now (hopefully) fixed the bug, but I've nobbled
csum_partial_copy_from_user to ensure that it will always oops the kernel
if called:

000000b4 <csum_partial_copy_from_user>:
  b4:   ee133f10        mrc     15, 0, r3, cr3, cr0, {0}
  b8:   e92d41fe        push    {r1, r2, r3, r4, r5, r6, r7, r8, lr}
  bc:   e3a03055        mov     r3, #85 ; 0x55
  c0:   ee033f10        mcr     15, 0, r3, cr3, cr0, {0}
  c4:   e7033003        str     r3, [r3, -r3]

and... it doesn't trigger.  I can only assume that this is because the
iMX6 ethernet interface uses TSO (which implies checksum offload), there's
no need to use these csum functions - and that would explain why it never
came up in my local testing.
