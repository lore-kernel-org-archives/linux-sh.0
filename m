Add Clock Domain support to the R-Car H1 Clock Pulse Generator (CPG)
driver using the generic PM Domain.  This allows to power-manage the
module clocks of SoC devices that are part of the CPG Clock Domain using
Runtime PM, or for system suspend/resume.

SoC devices that are part of the CPG Clock Domain and can be
power-managed through an MSTP clock should be tagged in DT with a proper
"power-domains" property.

Also update the reg property in the DT binding doc example to match the
actual dtsi, which uses #address-cells and #size-cells = 1, not 2.
