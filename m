Hi Laurent, Hi Daniel,

I am wondering what the status of this pull request is.  It would be nice
to get the arch/ changes into v3.17 but we are getting closer to v3.16-rc6
and I need to have things queued up before then.

I have also CCed Olof and the ARM SoC team (via arm@kernel.org) as
if Daniel does provide a stable branch that includes this pull request and
I use it as the basis for a branch with the arch changes then the
ARM SoC people would like to know about it before I send a pull request
for the arch/ changes.
