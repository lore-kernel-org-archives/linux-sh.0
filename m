Don't think so. board-mackerel.c uses DT in a really dull way - it doesn't 
call of_platform_populate(). It also initialises interrupts by calling 
sh7372_init_irq(), which would conflict with intc instances in sh7372.dtsi 
too, if the latter were used. And board-mackerel-reference.c doesn't 
register PFC internally.

Thanks
Guennadi
