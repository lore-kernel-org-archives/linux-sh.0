Yes, please.  The email discussion so far hasn't contained what I'm
looking for (if it had, I would have just inserted it and been done
with it).

Apparently it has to do with the stable DT rules, which I don't know.
A concrete example would probably help clear it up.

I've applied the parts that touch PCI.  I won't be offended if the
binding documentation patches go as-is via another tree.  It's just
that if *I'm* going to apply them, I'd like to understand better what
the benefit is.
