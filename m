I spoke too soon: apparently the statistical relevance of my reporting was
too low. I still see them from time to time, but I think less than before (no
numbers available).

Kconfig has the advantage that the minimal defconfigs will be smaller, so
less churn there.
However, it does mean you cannot disable the option anymore via your .config.

In this case it's a bit difficult to decide, as sh_eth will work both
with and without
the specific PHY-driver.

If no users want to disable it, I'd go for Kconfig.
