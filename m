I agree entirely. This is probably something that we should discuss
with the ARM SoC developers. But my feeling is that there should be
some scope for flexibility with regards to merge-order in such cases.

By which I mean we should try where possible, not to apply non-DT patches
on top of DT patches. But if circumstances arise where it seems to
be the best approach then we should to approach things pragmatically.

Yes, lets.

Sorry for not being clearer. By other patches I meant patches 2 - 6 of this
series.  It seems that we should wait and I'm quite happy to do so.
