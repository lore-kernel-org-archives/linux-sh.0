Sure, good idea!

Why shouldn't _noirq() be used? I understand that _noirq callbacks
assume that interrupts are not delivered.

It looks to me that most drivers seem to misuse _noirq to work around
ordering issues. They basically use suspend_late() or suspend_noirq()
because they want to be sure that they are suspended after other
drivers. For instance, i2c master controllers seem to want to suspend
using suspend_late() to suspend after the i2c devices on the bus.

Do you have any pointer to code that manages the device hierarchy? Or
is it up to the bus_type?

Exactly!

Sure, new callbacks are fine as well if you think that's better.

I can only speak for SuperH and a bit for ARM. I see a clear need for
for run-time state saving at least. And I think dev_pm_ops ->freeze()
and ->restore() seem like good matches for this, so yes, it's enough
to begin with.

I think (1) is the simplest and does not require much changes to begin
with. People can build stuff on top of this which we later can break
out and make generic.

For SuperH two callbacks for state saving and restoring is enough to
begin with. Functionality wise this is very similar to dev_pm_ops
->freeze() and ->restore() so I think just using those should be fine.
