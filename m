I'm a bit confused about this series in general. Patch 1 and 5 are both
marked RFC but 2/3/4 seem to be unrelated and intended for merging,
despite the fact I find the approach itself to be rather suspect. So why
exactly are these all lumped together?

Please do not create patch series that are intentionally muddled. Since
you have two distinct things here with completely different intentions
and you've not explicitly stated whether there's any dependencies between
the two it simply creates a giant mess.

A patch series should be logically structured in some way other than
"here's a bunch of random patches I have pending for this particular
driver", particularly if only parts of it are intended to be merged.
