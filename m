Thanks for posting the link to the device tree wiki/quoting from it.
I had faint memories of that quote, but couldn't remember where I read it.

Hehe ;-)

I think the tricky part is when a driver for "renesas,i2c-r8a7790" is updated
with a new feature for r8a7790, which doesn't necessarily exist in r8a7791.
Then the compatible entry above will cause breakage.

In our case, this probably won't happen, as we will have "renesas,i2c-r8a7791"
in the driver, but the driver could be forked in between the addition of
"renesas,i2c-r8a7790" and "renesas,i2c-r8a7791" in our non-ideal world.
