Hi Kevin,

Yes, I tested it only for x86 (as I had mentioned in the description
of the patch series). I just wanted to get comments on the design
and understand how it affects various architectures in question. It
looks to me as if the design should be okay and infact better for
architectures like ARM since they do not have different idle
states for different cpus and thus do not require per-cpu registration.
Global registration would work and be simpler; please correct me if I am
wrong.

Thanks for helping with this.
