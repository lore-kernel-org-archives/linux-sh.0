	Hi Simon, Magnus,

This patch series replaces the recently introduced "nor-jedec"
compatible value by "jedec,spi-nor" in all shmobile dts files,
cfr. commit 8947e396a8296c52 ('Documentation: dt: mtd: replace
"nor-jedec" binding with "jedec,spi-nor"'), which was applied in
v4.1-rc4.

As the "bad" compatible values are already in -next for v4.2, these
updates should be applied and queued for v4.2, too.

Thanks for applying!

when I'm talking to journalists I just say "programmer" or something like that.
