Ok, here's what I've just done.

1. checkout -next tag next-20130909

commit 98926a8004b453089368fda456b8c869240e9953
Author: Stephen Rothwell <sfr@canb.auug.org.au>
Date:   Mon Sep 9 16:05:53 2013 +1000

    Add linux-next specific files for 20130909

2. built and booted a kernel for kzm9g (.config available on request)

3. cpufreq failed to initialise:

cpufreq_cpu0: failed to find cpu0 node
cpufreq-cpu0: probe of cpufreq-cpu0 failed with error -2

due to commit f837a9b5ab05c52a07108c6f09ca66f2e0aee757 - as reported in 
another thread.

4. reverted that commit, resolving a trivial conflict. Added a debug 
output in __cpufreq_driver_target() of

 
 	if (cpufreq_disabled())
 		return -ENODEV;
+	pr_info("%s() %d\n", __func__, policy->transition_ongoing);
 	if (policy->transition_ongoing)
 		return -EBUSY;
 

Built and booted, got

cpufreq: __cpufreq_driver_target(): 1

printed out 4 times from the beginning.

5. tried

echo powersave > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_governor

the above output appeared 2 more times - no frequency change resulted.

6. reverted commit dceff5ce18801dddc220d6238628619c93bc3cb6, built booted 
- cpufreq works again.

Hope the above is enough.

Thanks
