What kind of bus is this? All buses I have looked at do serialize reads
and writes to the same address at the minimum, and all sane buses
serialize them when they happen to the same device, but it's harder
to do when you need to serialize e.g. a read with a previous write
to another device or another bus connected to the same device.

Let me try to say what I understand from reading the code: These
accessors are only used on one function, and there is no DMA
involved here. The function does (simplified):

void tmio_mmc_pio_irq(struct page *, void __iomem *io, size_t count, bool read)
{
	void *virt;

	/* called from interrupt handler, but let's disable interrupts some more ;) */
	local_irq_disable();

	/* if highmem, map the page */
	virt = kmap_atomic(page);
	if (read) {
		wmb();
		readsw(io, virt, count);
	} else {
		writesw(io, virt, count);
		rmb();
	}

	kunmap_atomic(virt);
}

I don't think there is any other I/O involved, so the barriers are probably
needed to synchronize with whoever is accessing the page on the other
side of the kmap/kunmap. Did the bug happen on highmem?

The barriers here should probably be outside of the I/O accessors
and in the tmio_mmc_pio_irq() function, but I still can't explain
why they are needed here.

Maybe the runtime-pm code uses __raw_writel or writel_relaxed where it
should be using writel?

Or maybe there some effect with disabling the caches and not flushing
them properly in advance here?

In any case, I would expect a much more specific changeset text for a
patch like this.
