Right, and can this never fail?

Ok, fair enough.

I mean specifically this code in em_i2c_slave_irq():

                        /* Send data */
                        event = status & I2C_BIT_STD0 ?
                                I2C_SLAVE_READ_REQUESTED :
                                I2C_SLAVE_READ_PROCESSED;
                        i2c_slave_event(priv->slave, event, &value);
                        writeb(value, priv->base + I2C_OFS_IIC0);

With my current code to turn i2c_slave_event() into an empty inline function
in case of !CONFIG_I2C_SLAVE, the compiler knows that "value" is uninitialized
at the point where we write it to the register, and warns about it.

The code will of course never run if slave mode is not allowed, but we should
still shut up the warning, either by making the inline i2c_slave_event
set 'value' to zero or 0xff, or by adding an error check:

			ret = i2c_slave_event(priv->slave, event, &value);
			if (!ret)
				 writeb(value, priv->base + I2C_OFS_IIC0);

and making the empty i2c_slave_event() function return -ENOSYS or -ENOTSUPP.
