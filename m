Sure, the driver can of course control the clocks manually in its PM callbacks 
if it needs to. The point, however, is to control the clocks from core code 
whenever possible. We thus need to define exact semantics to make sure each 
side knows what tasks to perform, and what to expect from the other side. For 
instance, in the DT case, the runtime PM core can easily get the list of the 
clocks used by the device from its DT node, but how can it know which clock(s) 
it should manage automatically and which clock(s) it should leave for the 
driver to control ?
