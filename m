Yes, this works for me. How persistent should the kill-switch be? I assume it 
doesn't make much sense to make a sysfs toggle, because then it would still be 
open to abuse. I'd rather see it specified on boot and never changed. Agreed?

Something like "enable_dev_mem" on the kenrel command line (default is 
disabled).

On a similar note, I should probably rip off write_mem() completely and 
disallow PROT_WRITE mmapping of the device. Right?

It can be used for DoS, but if you have permission for the ioctl(), then you 
probably also have easier ways to kill the system.
