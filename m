Hi Olof, Hi Kevin, Hi Arnd,

Please consider these Renesas ARM based SoC DT updates for v4.4.

This pull request is based on
"Renesas ARM Based SoC Cleanup for v4.4,
tagged as renesas-cleanup-for-v4.4,
which you have already pulled.

The main differences since v1 of this pull-request are:

* Removed "Add missing CPG/MSTP Clock Domain for sound "* patches
  which are fixes now present in the ARM SoC fixes branch
  via the renesas-fixes-for-v4.3 tag of the renesas tree.
* Enable more hardware via DT
  + Enable PCI, USB PHY and HS, and VIN support on r8a7794/Silk
  + Add initial support for r8a7791/porter
  + Add common file for AA121TD01 panel

The following changes since commit 04418c23a9411b85b8789eab5f4397bcbd62b7b4:
