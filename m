Right. I would still prefer the different "compatible" property, but it's not
an extremely important thing here. Regarding the naming of the "compatible"
string, I would not use v1 and v2 postfixes though, unless that is what they
are called in the data sheet. Ideally we would know the exact version
of the IP block that went into the chip and drop the "shmobile-" part.

That would make it something like "toshiba,sdhi-1.23.45". If you cannot
easily find out those versions, the next best solution would be naming it
after the chip that first used a particular version of that IP block,
like "renesas,shmobile1234-sdhi". The device tree include file for
shmobile5678 should then list the sdhi part as being compatible with
the "reneasas,shmobile1234-sdhi" if they are the same, or as
a separate "reneasas,shmobile5678-sdhi" if they behave in a different
way. In either case, I would also list the "toshiba,sdhi" name as
the more generic option in the "compatible" list, but that is optional.
