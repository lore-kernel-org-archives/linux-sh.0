What about this (untested):

This code is meant to be executed from ROM which means a very tailored 
kernel configuration.  In that case it makes little sense to have 
CONFIG_ARM_PATCH_PHYS_VIRT nor CONFIG_AUTO_ZRELADDR turned on anyway.

The right dependency would be CONFIG_AUTO_ZRELADDR, not 
ARM_PATCH_PHYS_VIRT.  The later concerns the final kernel image, not the 
decompressor.

The right solution to the U-Boot problem is to remove uImage creation 
from the kernel entirely.  The U-Boot image format should be created at 
_installation_ time, not at build time.  The fact that the U-Boot image 
format is (or was until very recently) inflexible is not Linux's fault.

If the uImage build target is to remain in the kernel, it should be 
marked incompatible with a multi-arch config.  There is no point 
distributing a multi-arch kernel image when wrapped into a uImage 
format.
