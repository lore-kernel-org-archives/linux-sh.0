Renesas ARM Based SoC DT Fixes for v3.14

Revert the addition of SSI clocks to DT for the
r8a7790 (R-Car H2) and r8a7791 (R-Car M2) SoCs.

Unfortunately these patches prevent booting the
r8a7790-based Lager board and r8a7791-based Koelsch board
to the point where a serial output is available.

A solution to this problem is being sought but has not
yet been finalised so in the mean time revert the changes.
