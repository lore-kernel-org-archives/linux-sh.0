I'm fully aware of this issue and was not trying to solve that here. On
the positive side, it does help highlight drivers which are not single
kernel ready by explicitly including mach headers which is easily
searched for.

I'm finding some new breakage as I rebase to the latest mainline
(gpio-pxa.c). So the next version may have a few more fixes like this one.
