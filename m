Perhaps we should factor the conventional clk_enable into two parts (say) :-
 a)  clk_setup  : Which does exactly what can't be done in atomic context.
                         Like setting PLLs i.e, if that needs to sleep.
b)  clk_enable : Everything else that gets the clock signals running.

The drivers could do clk_setup in probe/open and clk_enable right before the
the actual need of the clock. That way, drivers don't have to bother
with platform/clock
peculiarities while trying their best to save power.
Of course, power that can't be saved now, won't be saved then.
