I don't blame you for the misunderstanding - as you see there are a
couple of interrupt controllers just from Renesas SoC division, and
you probably get to see similar situations with every SoC vendor.
Quite a few different interrupt controllers to keep track of! =)

Yes, correct. GIC and per-GPIO interrupts provided by gpio-em.c.

What may not be so obvious is the GPIO interface provided by the PFC
code that is now located in drivers/pinctrl/sh-pfc/. There used to be
a function-only GPIOs in the PFC code but we're now moving over to
PINCTRL thanks to great effort by Laurent. So besides the old
function-only GPIOs provided by PFC there are also regular GPIOs
exported by the PFC code. Those regular GPIOs exported by the PFC do
not have any built-in interrupt controller - instead the external IRQs
handled by C) and D) above are used.

Other GPIO blocks like gpio-em.c and gpio-rcar.c have built-in
interrupt controllers and can do per-GPIO interrupts.

> Coming back to INTC, are you planning to use the same binding for A and C?

I was not planning on that, no. To be honest, at this point I am not
sure which way forward is best for A).

> Which of them the binding you posted earlier for?

Regarding A), I wrote some local DT prototype patches for INTC a year
or two ago, showing how things could be done and how we can start
using DT. Then I handed the job over to other people. However, from
there my advice of incremental development was ignored and instead
more complete bindings were developed directly without much review. So
I wouldn't say that I posted the bindings myself. Right now I'm very
hands-off in that area.

As for C), those DT bindings were done by me. They are however not
compatible with A). The hardware is different. C) is basically a
special case subset of A).

I agree that in some cases it may make sense to split the SH bits from
ARM, but I wonder how much we would win for the INTC.

Right now I'm considering converting r8a7740 to use B) and C) (if
possible), and if so then the only ARM SoC using A) for main interrupt
controller left is sh7372.

For sh7372 we could simply try to use C) for board-level interrupts
(and board level DT) but keep the SoC portion in C with A) until the
SoC is being phased out. Or we could have a simple compatible
"renesas,intc-sh7372" with tables in C using irq domain to support DT,
but that would be exactly as my first incremental development task
that wasn't followed...

What would you do?

Thanks for your help,
