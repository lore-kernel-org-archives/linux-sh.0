Subject: [PATCH 0/3] Generalise ARM perf-events backend for oprofile

The perf-events backend for OProfile that Will Deacon wrote in
8c1fc96f6fd1f361428ba805103af0d0eee65179 ("ARM: 6072/1: oprofile: use
perf-events framework as backend") is of use to more architectures
than just ARM. Move the code into drivers/oprofile/ so that SH can use
it instead of the nearly identical copy of its OProfile code.

The benefit of the backend is that it becomes necessary to only
maintain one copy of the PMU accessor functions for each architecture,
with bug fixes and new features benefiting both OProfile and perf.

Note that I haven't been able to test these patches on an ARM board to
see if I've caused any regressions. If anyone else could do that I'd
appreciate it.

This patch series is based on tip/master.
