This series looks really good to me.  Just a minor question about a
possible next step...

Do you have plans to use pm_genpd_attach_cpuidle() for this eventually,
maybe by checking if the enclosing node is a CPU?  If not, are there
other plans to handle idle for the power domains that contain CPUs?
