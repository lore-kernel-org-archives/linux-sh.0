ARM: shmobile: r8a73a4 APE6EVM board support V2

[PATCH 01/03] ARM: shmobile: APE6EVM base support V2
[PATCH 02/03] ARM: shmobile: APE6EVM PFC support
[PATCH 03/03] ARM: shmobile: APE6EVM LAN9220 support

This series is V2 of initial support for the APE6EVM board.

The APE6EVM board makes use of the r8a73a4 SoC and has a
couple of different I/O devices on board, but with this
series only support for the SCIFA0 UART and the Ethernet
chip is included.

In the future support for more I/O devices will be added as
incremental feature patches.

Changes since V1:
- Went from single patch to series
- Use ape6evm_add_standard_devices() to setup SoC devices and clocks
- Use PFC to configure SCIFA0
- Add Ethernet support including PFC support

For more details please see the individual patches.
