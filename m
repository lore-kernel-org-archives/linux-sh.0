OK.

The rationale behind this is that RSPI DT would apply to RSPI on RZ/A1H.
The spi-rspi driver also supports legacy SH7757, which may not move to
DT anytime soon.
For symmetry, I did the same thing for QSPI, which applies to QSPI
on R-Car H2 and M2 (upon second look, it should be "renesas,qspi-rcar-gen2",
as E1/M1/H1 have HSPI).

Does this makes sense? Or do you still prefer plain "renesas,rspi" and
"renesas,qspi", and perhaps "renesas,rspi-sh" if we ever get DT there?

OK.

OK.

But we don't need it in the spi node in the actual .dts, as we already have
"interrupt-parent = <&gic>;" in the enclosing node, right?

Thanks!
