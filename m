It's there now:

http://www.arm.linux.org.uk/developer/patches/viewpatch.php?ida38/1

Anything I can do to make a second pull request happen? There are
quite a few patches that depend on this one, so I posted it well in
advace at March 10. The patch was kindly reviewed by you a bit later.
And now I got an ack. Unfortunately I didn't proceed and submit it to
the ARM-specific patch tracking system.
