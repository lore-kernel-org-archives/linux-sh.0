This doesn't make sense, you can only change the voltages if you hold a
reference to the regulator.

Yes, you ought to to be safe and like I say if you want to manage the
voltage then you need to keep a reference to the regulator.

Obviously not, though if you've got explicit code in to handle dummy
regulators you're rather missing the point.  Their entire purpose is to
provide a crutch to keep the system going if bits are missing from the
bindings, they're not intended to be used in production.
