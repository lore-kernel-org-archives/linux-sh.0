And I'm quite unsurprisingly not, as I've asked for a v2.

The "adi,adxl34x" compatible string is deprecated. That means we still support 
it in the driver for device trees that haven't been updated, but it shouldn't 
be used forward by new device trees. That's why the device tree sources 
contained in the kernel shouldn't use it, especially given that they often 
serve as references for device trees shipped out of tree.
