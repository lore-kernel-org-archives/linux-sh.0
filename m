I guess you have hit two of the special cases here:

- dmatest uses the memory-to-memory DMA engine interface, not the slave
  API, so you don't have to configure a slave at all

- smc91x (and its smc911x.c relative) are apparently special in that they
  use they use the DMA slave API but (AFAICT) require programming
  the dmaengine hardware into a memory-to-memory transfer with no
  DMA slave request signal and completely synchronous operation
  (the IRQ handler polls for the DMA descriptor to be complete),
  see also https://lkml.org/lkml/2018/4/3/464 for the discussion about
  the recent rework of that driver's implementation.

Another point about smc91x is that it only uses DMA on the PXA platform,
which is not part of the "multiplatform" ARM setup. It's likely that no
other platform actually has a DMA engine that can talk to this device in
the absence of a request signal, or that on more modern CPU cores,
a readsl() is actually just as fast, but it avoids the setup cost of talking
to the dma engine. Possibly both of the above.

Is smc91x the only driver that you want to make use of the DMA engine?
I suspect that every other one currently relies on passing a slave ID
shdma_chan_filter into dma_request_slave_channel_compat() or
dma_request_channel() , which are some of the interfaces we want to
remove in the future, to make everything work the same across
all platforms.

shdma_chan_filter() is one of those that expect its pointer argument to
be a number that is in turn associated with an sh_dmae_slave_config
structure in the platform data of the dma engine. What the newer
dma_request_chan() interface does is to pass a pointer to the
slave device and a string as identifier for the same data, which then
gets associated through the dma_slave_map. On smc91x, both
the device and name argument are NULL, which triggers the special
case in the pxa dmaengine driver.

Ok. Have you found any reason to keep it around though?
