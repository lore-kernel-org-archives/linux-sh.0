Oh well... This certainly means we'll have to clean this mess as some 
drivers do it on their own while some others don't.  Some drivers also 
loop on !need_resched() while some others simply return on the first 
interrupt.

A later patch removes it anyway.  But if it is really necessary to 
enable interrupts then the core will do it but with a warning now.
