That I'm happy to go along with though I don't understand the motivation
for it. And regardless of how the patches go in I'd prefer if they were
split as I suggested above.


What I'm not so happy about is us potentially moving a problem from being a
compile time error, which is easy to observe, to a run-time behavioural
problem, which may be much less obvious to the beholder.
