Hmm, I just noticed that in fact shmobile is the only remaining
platform that uses CONFIG_MEMORY_START with a per-board or per-soc
setting.

Right, you can probably make CONFIG_ZBOOT_ROM_MMCIF and
CONFIG_ZBOOT_ROM_SH_MOBILE_SDHI depend on !ARM_PATCH_PHYS_VIRT

If this doesn't work, we probably also need to find a solution to
build multiple uImage files from the same vmlinux when building a
multiplatform kernel.
