Hi,

I have done some tests on a Renesas Mackerel board (Guennadi likely has
one too) both with and without my "mmc, ARM: Add zboot from eSD support for
SuperH Mobile ARM" change - which needs to go through RMK's tree
and is the motivation for the " mmc: tmio_mmc: Move some defines into a
shared header" patch.

I didn't notice any problems.

FWIW

I have no particular objections though I do agree that it
is a lot of churn at this stage of the release cycle.
