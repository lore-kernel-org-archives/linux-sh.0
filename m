Subject: [RFC v8 00/9] ARM: shmobile: DT initialisation of INTC and GIC

The aims of this series are:

* Add DT bindings to to INTC
* Allowing sh7372 and r8a7740 ARM shmobile SoCs to use DT
  to initialise INTCA

Change since v7
* Squash the first and second patch of the series and rename there result
  "SH: intc: Add support OF for INTC"

Changes v5 and v7 (v6 was not publicly released)
* Drop support for sh73a0 SoC.
  To be useful this requires a fuller initialisation than jsut INCA.
  In particular, cascade IRQs that are shared between INTC and GIC
  need to be handled.
* Drop board support
  This will be revisited on a per-board basis, ideally with
  filler INTC initialisation via DT in place
* Drop GIC initialisation
  This will also be revisited on a per-board basis.
* Remove unused INTC DT helper functions


Status:

I am reasonably happy with this series and plan to merge the shmobile portions.

Paul, I forget if I asked you this before or not, but could you let me know
if you would like to handle the intc patch, the first patch of the
series, or if you are comfortable with it going through my tree.

Git and diffstat information provided for review.
