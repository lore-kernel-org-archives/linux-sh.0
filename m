Regarding patches 1 and 2: these should of course be merged with Mauro's
patches that make this particular change (patch 3/8), otherwise it would
break git bisect.

Anyway,

Acked-by: Hans Verkuil <hans.verkuil@cisco.com> for the changes in patch
1 and 2, as long as they are added to Mauro's patch 3/8.

Regards,

	Hans
