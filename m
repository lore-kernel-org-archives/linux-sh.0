Ok, thanks for the clarification.

Ok, makes sense. Good to know that this actually works. An idea that
may be helpful in some corner cases: if you can set up the small window as

           0x02000000 0 0 0 0xfe200000 0 0x00200000

or even

           0x02000000 0 0 0 0xfe200000 0 0x00100000
           0x02000000 0 0x00f00000 0 0xfe200000 0 0x00100000

then you will be able to map devices with legacy nonrelocatable ISA
memory BARs such as VGA cards that have PCI resources in the first MB
of bus space, and in the end of the first 16MB.
