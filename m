For me I simply want to remove the custom "pen down" handler for tsc2007
from ecovec24. Unfortunately it seems with the current code you have to
switch from interrupt delivery to GPIO access on the board and it is not
really compatible with common handler and ecovec24 is the only board
that needs this custom handler support. If we can remove it then we can
switch the driver to use generic device properties only.

Note that the driver is still functional without the pendown handler, it
uses alternative methods for detecting lifting the pen, but they are
less reliable. I wonder how many people use ecovec24 with the
touchscreen.

Thanks.
