Yes they are, although the hardware is simpler in those cases, so there's less 
potential issues. I don't have a specific concern here, just a feeling of 
uneasiness coming from publishing DT bindings that can't be properly reviewed 
by someone out of our team. We're too familiar with the hardware to take a 
step back and see the bindings from an external point of view, which is why 
I'd like an external review before committing to any DT binding stability.

There's of course no reason to delay this patch (well, except for all the 
other small comments I've made :-)), but if it were me I would mark the 
corresponding bindings with a big "EXPERIMENTAL" warning.
