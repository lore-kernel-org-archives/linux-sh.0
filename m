Hi Olof, Hi Kevin, Hi Arnd,

Please consider these Renesas ARM based SoC CPG MSTP clock domain updates
for v4.3.

This pull request is based on "Third Round of Renesas ARM Based SoC DT
Updates for v4.3", tagged as renesas-dt3-for-v4.3, which I have also sent a
pull-request for.

The reason for that base is that the DT changes in this series update nodes
added in that tag.

This series begins with driver changes and follows up with DT changes.
The latter depend on the former.


The following changes since commit 94bdc48d55ca10f90b4a625f0e443197e0013557:

  ARM: shmobile: sh73a0 dtsi: Add missing "gpio-ranges" to gpio node (2015-08-05 06:39:28 +0900)
