Hi Guennadi,

these changes seem to be reasonable to me.

Are there any dependencies for the sh_eth patch?
I assume this will be handled by David Miller through the net-next tree.
Are there any dependencies? The last time I checked the DT bindings
for sh_eth had not been merged.

For the remaining two patches, which I assume will go through my renesas
tree:
* Are there any dependencies that aren't satisfied by the of-intc branch?
* Could you get some Acks. At least from Laurent?
