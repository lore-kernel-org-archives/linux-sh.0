It is correct.  More specifically, the problem is, for example, that there
may be two different low-power states of the system that may be entered
when the device is suspended, one of which is relatively shallow, but
having a low exit latency, while the other one is deep with a correspondingly
longer exit latency.  This happens when the device is a member of a power
domain that may be turned off entirely when it is suspended under certain
conditions and at the same time the device's individual clock may be turned
off and on almost instantaneously.  In that case there's no reason to avoid
suspending the device whenever possible, allowing its clock to be turned
off to save energy, but there may be a good reason to avoid turning off the
power domain due to latency constraints.  No amount of playing with
autosuspends is going to help here, unless the driver is aware of the exact
system hardware configuration it is in, which is rather impractical if you
think of universal drivers (such that may be used with different platforms,
for example).

Thanks,
Rafael
