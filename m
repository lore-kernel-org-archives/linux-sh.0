There are a few cases where PLL clocks would benefit from a clk_enable()
that can sleep, but for us these are almost all in the device space. Most
of the SoCs however have fairly straightforward clock topologies where
the root clock in question is an external oscillator that can't be
disabled, and anything chained below that sits behind a PLL divider or
multiplier bank that can likewise be adjusted atomically. The vast
majority of the clocks below that can likewise be trivially
enabled/disabled from atomic context.

In response to your query, no, we do not hide those details. Each on-chip
clock generator is fed by a default oscillator via one input or a board
specific one via another, with a frequency that can vary wildly depending
on the implementation. In general we require the SoC code to register its
clock topology, the board code to work out which source its fed from (and
at what frequency), and then also providing an initial rate propagation
kick down the tree to make sure that all of the core clocks are set up
sensibly and to synchronize hardware/software state.

Having said that, we _do_ have clocks where rate changes are non-trivial
due to it being necessary to synchronize with internal timing circuitry,
but at the moment we don't really deal with those (this is something we'd
have to deal with for dynamically scaling the bus clock for example,
which requires a special watchdog overflow to relock an internal PLL,
which in general we leave fixed).

In general I would be happy to have a sleepable variant of clk_enable(),
it's just making clk_enable() sleepable by default or treating clocks
usable from atomic context as the special case that I take issue with,
particularly when the opposite is the demonstratable norm.
