No, it does something pretty different: it selects the best _parent_ 
frequency to optimize that of the _child_. So, it actually tells you "to 
configure your clock as close as possible to frequency X you have to 
reconfigure its parent with frequency Y." Which I don't think any of the 
aforementioned functions does.

Well, there is a reason, why this is marked an "RFC":-) I also don't like 
very much touching clock internals in platform code, but in a way it is 
specific for each case. This implementation only works for clocks, whose 
divisors are integer numbers in a certain range (without holes). Ok, with 
clk_get_parent() the other two callbacks .clk_set_rate_parent() and 
.clk_get_rate_parent() are automatically not needed, which is good! And I 
would be happy to try to convert the ap4evb_clk_optimize() function into a 
generic helper too, if we reach such an agreement.

Thanks
