Good question.

My feeling is that as it relates to Renesas ARM SoCs that
responsibility at least in part defaults to the Renesas ARM SoC
maintainers, Magnus and myself.

So I think it would be best if the following were CCed on any patches
to this driver:

Simon Horman <horms@verge.net.au>
Magnus Damm <magnus.damm@gmail.com>
linux-sh@vger.kernel.org

I would not be opposed for there being a MAINTAINERS file entry to that effect.

I will let Valentine volunteer himself if he wants to.
