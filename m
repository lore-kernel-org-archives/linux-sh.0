Hi,

This is the first pull request that has a few patches on the same branch,
so while it's something I was thinking about on previous pull request,
for this one it's more obvious. So here we go :-)

For background, we tend to organize the arm-soc tree a little different from
how some other maintainer trees are organized, to aggregate work across vendor
branches and make it more obvious which kind of patches are adding and removing
cod ein the tree.

Our organization of the arm-soc tree is in a few broad topics that cut across
all platforms. They tend to be, in rough order:

* Fixes that weren't critical for the previous release (fixes-non-critical)
* Cleanups that removes or refactors code
* New SoC support or major updates
* SoC drivers updates
* board support / changes
* defconfigs
* device tree

+ sometimes other special topic branches depending on what's going on that
merge window, like pinctrl updates (SoC side) or clock updates.

You can have one branch depend/build on top of another, we can normally resolve
those dependencies. We prefer them in the same rough order as above to avoid
cyclical dependencies between different vendors though.


So, on your branch:

You seem to be organizing your branches more along the topics of which chip
they relate to, for example Marzen and r8a7779 above. That worked out well when
there were only one or two patches per branch since we could just file them
into the area where we consider they fit (i.e. see my replies to those emails
about where they fit in).

This is the first larger branch, and I think you should split it up to:

Those are board updates

SoC update since it seems to mostly be clock related.

>       marzen: add SDHI0 support

defconfig for part of the change, board for the other. Why was I/DNOTIFY
updated in the defconfig, by the way?


> Simon Horman (1):

This would fit on a defconfig branch as well.


For future pull request as well, feel free to think about how the patches
would fit into similar topics to above as well and organize them as such
at your level too. If you want several branches of the same kind, that's
no problem, but it's by far preferrably if they're organized along the
rouch topics above.
