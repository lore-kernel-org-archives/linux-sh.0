Right now there is an intentional difference between the "C" version
of the board code and the DT-only version:

The "C" version of board code relies on DTS for architected timer and
GIC. Besides that, platform devices are used. Other devices in DTS are
not used at this point.

The DT version (DT_MACHINE_START in setup-r8a73a4.c) is using DTS only.

Would you like me to  change to "C" version of the code to use DTS to
describe more devices?

Thanks,
