This series moves the r7s72100 platfrom from the legacy clock implementation to
the common clock framework.

This series has been tested with the renesas-devel-v3.14-rc4-20140227 tag. It
has a build dependency [1] because it uses the clkdev workaround. If you want
to boot into a console, you also have a runtime dependency [2]. A git branch
can be found here:

Patches 1-5 is the minimal set to activate CCF and get the board booting into a
console. Patches 6-8 add SCIF support, 9+10 I2C support, and 11+12 SPI support.

Changes since V1:

Patches 2 and 6-12 are new. Patches 1,3,4 got updates, see the changelog there.

Patch 1 should probably go via clock tree (it has no dependencies). The rest
via shmobile. Please apply.
