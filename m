Hi Laurent,

Thanks for your efforts. Hate to slow things down, but this last hunk
looks wrong to me. I believe the reason for the #ifdef is that
non-Renesas IP may be using the tmio_mmc driver, at least they used
to. Not sure if anyone is using DMA Engine though. If I were you I
would play it safe and simply update the #ifdef with same kind of
dependencies that the Kconfig bits have.

Also, it would of course be nice to clean up the driver, perhaps with
a feature flag for this special register or why not simply move the
code to the sdhi file. But that's not really related to your
multiplatform kconfig change, is it? =)
