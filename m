Hi Geert,

Sorry for the delayed answer. I don't have an idea for 1), yet.

The reason why I added dev_pm_domain_detach() in that path was because
of the call to acpi_dev_pm_detach() that existed there already.

acpi_dev_pm_detach was added by Rafael in commit
94d76d5de38d7502c3e78fcd6bf50da95e3e0361 (platform / ACPI:
Attach/detach ACPI PM during probe/remove/shutdown).

From genpd point of view, I think it safe to remove the call to
dev_pm_domain_detach() from platform_drv_shutdown(), but I can't tell
from ACPI point of view.

Moreover, we still need to looking into 1), as it's probably causing
other issues as well.

Kind regards
Uffe
