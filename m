Depending on the GIC variant, the GIC module has one or more clock
inputs. Document the optional "clocks" and "clock-names" properties,
and their possible values, based on the Technical Reference Manuals.
optional.

Add the optional "power-domains" property.

This will allow to describe in DT the relationship between the GIC and
the Clock and/or Power Domain topology on SoCs where this is relevant
and needed for proper operation.

Note: As the current GIC driver doesn't support Runtime PM yet, PM
Domain constraints must be handled elsewhere in e.g. platform code.

Note: v1 was Acked-by: Rob Herring <robh@kernel.org>, but I didn't add
      it, due to the addition of clock-names.

v2:
  - Add "clock-names",
  - Document clock inputs on various GIC variants.

Clock inputs are based on the following documentation:
  - "ARM11 MPCore Processor Technical Reference Manual" (r2p0),
  - "Cortex-A9 MPCore Technical Reference Manual" (r4p1, r2p0),
  - "Cortex-A15 Technical Reference Manual" (r4p0, r2p0),
  - "CoreLink GIC-400 Generic Interrupt Controller Technical Reference
    Manual" (r0p1, r0p0),
  - "PrimeCell Generic Interrupt Controller (PL390) Technical Reference
    Manual" (r0p0).

I could not find clock input information in:
  - "ARM1176JZF Development Chip Technical Reference Manual" (r0p0),
  - "Cortex-A7 MPCore processors" (r0p5, r0p3).

Other:
  - "brcm,brahma-b15-gic" seems to be always used together with
    "arm,cortex-a15-gic".

No access to datasheets:
  - "qcom,msm-8660-qgic",
  - "qcom,msm-qgic2".
