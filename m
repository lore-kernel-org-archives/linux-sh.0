Hi Olof, Hi Kevin, Hi Arnd,

Please consider these Renesas ARM based SoC cleanups v3.16.

This pull request is based on Renesas ARM Based SoC Updates for v3.16,
tagged as renesas-soc-for-v3.16, which you have already pulled.


This series includes dependencies that do not fit easily into the usual
inter-branch dependencies and as such I have grouped them together in a
single branch.


The following changes since commit e35db38d66d1e4007cfc1bb90a05e11b4aaee2a8:

  ARM: shmobile: r8a7778/bockw: Move "select RENESAS_INTC_IRQPIN" under SoC (2014-04-14 11:28:43 +0900)
