The patch looks ok to me, and I've queued it up in the next/defconfig
branch for 4.2 now.

In general, I think it's easier if you take all patches at first and
then forward them to us, that way we can rely on you to have an
overview of what is missing.

If you only have one patch for a particular branch, sending a patch
(instead of a pull request) to arm@kernel.org works as well, but it's
less ambiguous if you relay that patch with your signed-off-by line
added than to have us figure out whether you want the patch to be
applied directly or not.
