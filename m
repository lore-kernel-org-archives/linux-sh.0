Subject: [PATCH] ARM: gic: Document Power and Clock Domain optional properties

On some SoCs, the GIC may be part of a PM Domain (hardware Power and/or
Clock Domain).  Document the related optional DT properties.

Note: As the current GIC driver doesn't support Runtime PM yet, PM
Domain constraints must be handled elsewhere in e.g. platform code.

To preserve DT stability, we would like to add these properties to the
affected shmobile dtsi files.
