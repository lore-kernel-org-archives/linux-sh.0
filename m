Ok.

Both of htese approaches sound fine. If there is only a single odd
one out, it makes sense to have a hardwired implementation for that
one. I rejected that approach originally because I wanted something
more generic, and it seems you have done exactly that with the
irq-renesas-intc-irqpin driver.
