This makes our driver programming life easier.


For example, let's see drivers/tty/serial/8250/8250_of.c


The "clock-frequency" DT property takes precedence over "clocks" property.
So, it is valid to probe the driver with a NULL pointer for info->clk.


        if (of_property_read_u32(np, "clock-frequency", &clk)) {

                /* Get clk rate through clk driver if present */
                info->clk = devm_clk_get(&ofdev->dev, NULL);
                if (IS_ERR(info->clk)) {
                        dev_warn(&ofdev->dev,
                                "clk or clock-frequency not defined\n");
                        return PTR_ERR(info->clk);
                }

                ret = clk_prepare_enable(info->clk);
                if (ret < 0)
                        return ret;

                clk = clk_get_rate(info->clk);
        }


As a result, we need to make sure the clk pointer is valid
before calling clk_disable_unprepare().


If we could support pointer checking in callees, we would be able to
clean-up lots of clock consumers.
