Hi Olof,

Thanks for your email. I agree that the number of board file commits
is definitely larger than zero so some clarification is in order.

As you probably recall, we earlier agreed on not adding any new board
files. That part is clear I believe so I will skip that.

Regarding the legacy board code, we have quite ok hardware support
coverage as it is now, but some devices drivers are of course still
under development. This means that in some cases integration is on
going or has not happened yet. You may see those kind of changes as
significant commits in the pull requests for board support.

In general we want to use upstream to host our continued incremental
development efforts. We do however often prioritize hardware support
over DT binding design in an early stage of driver development. This
to learn about the hardware and see what kind of abstractions that
need to be done. Once when we feel that the driver has good enough
hardware coverage then we commit to DT bindings.

In the Legacy Lager/Koelsch board code the following devices are
supported as platform devices:

ETHER, SCIF, DU, I2C, SATA*, USB*, MSIOF*, SDHI*, QSPI*, MMCIF,
Audio*, VIN*, Thermal, IRQC, PFC, CMT

* Platform device support under development in v3.15-pre

In the Multiplatform DT for Lager/Koelsch the following devices have DT support:

ETHER, SCIF**, I2C, SATA, MSIOF, SDHI, QSPI, MMCIF, Thermal, IRQC, PFC, CMT**

** Driver DT binding development on-going but integration not finalized

In Multiplatform DT for Lager/Koelsch the following devices lack DT bindings:

DU (drm/kms)
USB (host/function/phy)
Audio (alsa-soc + dmac)
VIN (v4l2 + camera sensor)

Our plan is to migrate over to the DT Multiplatform code base as soon
as ever possible, but at the same time we do not want to commit long
term support of potentially premature DT bindings. Our short term
solution to that is to use platform devices for a limited number of
devices together with DT Multiplatform.

If you would like use to adjust our way forwards please let me know!

Thanks,

/ magnus
