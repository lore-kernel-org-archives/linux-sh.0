Thanks, let's do that. But in fact, in a recent discussion it has been 
pointed out to me, that this property

+- toshiba,mmc-cap-sdio-irq	: SDIO IRQ signalling should be used, if
+	supported by the hardware, i.e. set MMC_CAP_SDIO_IRQ if
+	TMIO_MMC_SDIO_IRQ is also set

should be common for all MMC drivers: it should be possible to decide per 
SD interface, whether SDIO IRQ signalling should be enabled. What do you 
think? Shall we add a global "cap-sdio-irq" DT property instead of a 
toshiba-specific one?

Thanks
Guennadi
