Based on your work I have prepared a DT patch for the r8a7779.
I don't think that a C patch is necessary, please correct me if I am wrong.

Regarding the r8a7778: My reading of the documentation is that although a
pl310 L2 cache controller is present it is not available for use as there
is no L2 cache memory present. For this reason I do not think any patches
are required for the r8a7798.

I have queued up the DT changes for v4.5.
And tentatively queued up the C changes for v4.6.
