Well.

I'd prefer not to rebase any branches and move commits around if that's
what you're talking about, because I have a rule that my branches are not
rebased, except for the next one.

Now, there are three categories of commits in the soc-new branch,
"core soc updates", "board updates" and "new board support".  However,
"board updates" depend on "core soc updates" and go together with them
in two branches, "sh7372" and "r8a7740" (branch names are after SoC names
and each branch contains updates for the given SoC and boards based on it).
I can send a pull request to you separately for each of those branches,
if you prefer, or I can merge them together and send a pull request for
the whole (it actually is a separate branch in my tree, called "soc").

The new board support stuff is just that - commits adding support for
new boards.  Those things, however, depend on the "core soc updates" and
"board updates", so they are based on the "soc" branch (honestly, I don't
think they will work without the "core" changes).  So, while I could
send separate pull requests for the "armadillo800eva" and "kzm9g" branches,
I don't think that merging them without the changes in the "soc" branch will
do any good.

Thanks,
Rafael
