Hi Phil,

I'm trying to figure out if v4.4 has a build problem we need to fix.
If I understand correctly, "PCI: rcar: Convert to DT resource parsing
API" doesn't fix a build problem in the current tree; rather, it
removes a dependency on ARM so that we can build it on ARM64.

I assume you mean this one from Marc: https://lkml.org/lkml/2015/11/23/388
(Was that posted to linux-pci?  I don't see it in patchwork or my
linux-pci archives, so I hadn't seen it yet.)

How exactly is that related to this series?  If I merge these before
Marc's change, do we have a tree that builds for arm64 but doesn't
work?

What about the PCIe clock and DT changes you mention?  Is there a
reason to keep them separate?  Would it be feasible to include the DT
changes in the same patch as the driver change that uses those
changes?
