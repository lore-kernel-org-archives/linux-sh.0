That said I'm actually unsure what problems *exactly* are fixed by commit
7c30ed5.  The commit log only says that PRECHANGE or POSTCHAGE shouldn't be
called twice in a row, but it doesn't say why.  As the fallout indicates,
that actually happened before commit 7c30ed5 and nothing visibly broke, so
the benefit from having that commit is questionable to me.  On the other hand,
the commit itself is evidently broken, so what exactly is the reason for
keeping it?
