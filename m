priv_?x needs to be in a format that matches the filter function,
passing slave_id is basically always wrong, but dmaengine drivers
generally just ignore it.

Ok.

No other driver besides shmobile should use the slave_id, and a lot
of them cannot even use it because it is not in a format that makes
sense to a driver. Passing just chan_priv is the only way to do
a platform-independent driver with our API, so if we ever wanted to
use DMA on another SoC with this driver, we have to make that change
anyway.

Which SoCs use a different value here? Both of these look like
implementation details of the tmio_mmc, not of the integration
into the SoC, so they could just be keyed off the device identification.

Maybe we can hide the slave_id field in dma_slave_config within
'#if defined(CONFIG_ARCH_SH_MOBILE) && defined(CONFIG_ATAGS)' then?

I would really like to prevent other people from copying the mistake.
Apparently it has already happened on MIPS jz4740, but that one seems
easy enough to fix. Tegra used to use slave_id as well, but it's been
converted to DT-only a while ago and that is just dead code for them.

I've had a closer look at the existing code now and came up with a
patch that should work for all out-of-tree drivers you may be worried
about.

dmaengine: shdma: use normal interface for passing slave id

The shmobile platform is one of only two users of the slave_id field
in dma_slave_config, which is incompatible with the way that the
dmaengine API normally works.

I've had a closer look at the existing code now and found that all
slave drivers that pass a slave_id in dma_slave_config for SH do that
right after passing the same ID into shdma_chan_filter, so we can just
rely on that. However, the various shdma drivers currently do not
remember the slave ID that was passed into the filter function when
used in non-DT mode and only check the value to find a matching channel,
unlike all other drivers.

There might still be drivers that are not part of the kernel that rely
on setting the slave_id to some other value, so to be on the safe side,
this adds another 'real_slave_id' field to shdma_chan that remembers
the ID and uses it when a driver passes a zero slave_id in dma_slave_config,
like most drivers do.

Eventually, the real_slave_id and slave_id fields should just get merged
into one field, but that requires other changes.

Note: this also changes all affected drivers to no longer pass the slave_id
field in dma_slave_config, but those changes can also be done later, as
long as the main patch gets merged first.
