Sorry for my loose use of the word stable.

I meant a branch that will be incorporated into a future mainline release.
From your response above I assume that I can use v3.11-rcX for some values
of X.

Can I confirm that the commit I should be looking for is
cd717a2a3db96af1e308d5bdb76c9d5f8154b4bd
("ARM: Add .text annotations where required after __CPUINIT removal")?
