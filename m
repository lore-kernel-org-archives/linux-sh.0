For i.MX we can generally turn this into a spinlock. There are some exceptions
though. Most clocks directly visible for drivers are simple clock gates
which can be made atomic. The root clocks are often enough plls which
can't be enabled atomically, but where we have to spin until the pll is
locked. So we we have exactly the case Russell described: Whether we can
enable a clocks atomically depends on the parent (pll) being enabled or
disabled. We can work around this by calling clk_enable to the pll
explicitely from the platform code.

Quoting Russell:

Sounds like we should rather have s sleeping clk_enable and a
clk_enable_atomic. This way people can use standard clk_enable until
a 'scheduling while atomic' gives a hint in the right direction.
