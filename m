This is a topic that we started to discuss at the ELC a couple of months ago. 
My goal was to come up with a single API shared between DRM/KMS, FB and V4L2 
to handle graphics pipeline configuration. It quickly turned out that there 
was not enough shared interest between DRM and V4L2 developers to make this 
happen. Should we resume the discussion for FB, or would you rather want a 
separate FB-specific API ?

I'm not sure where the cleanup part of the patch went to, but definitely not 
in that branch :-/ I'll fix that and resubmit.
