Hi Arnd,

Thanks a lot for your help so far. I've found a bit of time to test stuff n=
ow.

Good with issues fixed, we like that. =3D)

We also like fixes ending up in mainline - does someone need to
resubmit their patches I wonder? =3D)

So I tried my AR6002 card - spent half an evening - but I couldn't get
it working with the driver in staging.

I tested at least 3 different drivers last time around, and I ended up
using the ar6k android driver:

6002-working/

I suppose I should retry with the out-of-tree driver above. Hm.

Ok, that looks good.

So I at least managed to test b43 with DMA enabled and your SDIO IRQ
patch applied.

Your SDIO IRQ patch significantly decreases interrupt load. Without
your SDIO IRQ patch about 100 interrupts per second are generated from
the polling. Same test but with the SDIO IRQ patch applied (b43 wlan0
up but not associated) I receive no IRQs at all until I perform some
kind of action like "iwlist wlan0 scan". I suppose this shows the
benefit of IRQs vs polled mode. =3D)

True, or that everyone just implements the same thing regardless of the spe=
c.

I'll try again next time I have a bit of time to spare. =3D)

Until then, is there any chance you can look into supporting INTC
forwarding in ENABLED for the CPU code but not setting
MMC_CAP_SDIO_IRQ? I wonder if there is any pending interrupt source
that drowns the CPU with the current code?
