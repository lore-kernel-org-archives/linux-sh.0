Ok, I spoke too soon...

Having this define next to the struct page definition works great for
riscv. However, making that happen in arm64 seems to be a nightmare. The
include chain in arm64 is tangled up so much that including mm_types
where this is needed seems to be extremely difficult.

Unless you have any ideas, this might not be possible.
