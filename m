Hi Russel, thanks for your feedback.
Well, SH (in CC) does not have this support. Indeed we posted it
initially to linux-sh only. We got useful feedback from Paul, Mike and
Nicolas suggesting to promote the ARM/SH solution based on the global
__stack_chk_guard variable as a generic solution for all other
architectures. This is why I thought to post to the LKML instead of each
linux-<arch> list.
The code is able to detect if the arch implementation is based on the
global (if so the generic implementation should work cleanly), otherwise
it will fail to compile when trying to include the
linux/asm/stackprotector.h. This is an easy way to detect the lack of an
arch specific implementation (but likely only x86 needs it... I don't know).

So the idea is to use the ARM code as generic's one (tested on SH
kernel). Mike Frysinger volunteered to try on blackfin for example.

cheers
