As they're tightly coupled and share the same register block, I guess
describing them together is ok. Is that clock example hypothetical, or
something we _will_ need in future?

If you're adding strings, there should be documentation. While it may be
a separate patch, we should _not_ add compatible strings to the kernel
without documentation. I'd like to see the documentation patch first.

Thanks,
