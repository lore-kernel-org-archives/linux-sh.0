Thanks.

Yes, you are correct that the previous version of the patch also
affected Lager. And that both r8a7790 and r8a7791 mention the MD21 bit
together with JTAG debugging.

I recently used the patch on Lager and I discovered that I apparently
had been running with MD21 on my Lager since forever, and surprisingly
it worked regardless. Since there is no documentation on r8a7790 or
r8a7791 I simply decided to handle them separately and only enable
where it is needed.

I've also been told that it is possible to allow SMP operation
together with JTAG, apparently some magic with RST is needed. It seems
that the power domains are treated differently depending on the MD21
setting. Not sure if this applies to both r8a7790 and r8a7791, but if
we end up with similar fixes we can consolidate. Until then I think
dealing with them one by one makes sense.

Cheers,
