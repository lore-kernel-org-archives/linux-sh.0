Hi Sergei,

Thanks a lot for the patch.

I think the PHY pins should be moved to the ethernet device. The reason for 
this is that the PHY device is discovered dynamically at runtime, and has thus 
no DT node associated with its struct device to control pinctrl automatically. 
This should probably be fixed, but in the meantime moving the PHY pins to the 
ethernet device should fix the problem.

As a last step we're missing a DT equivalent to our board code 
koelsch_ksz8041_fixup() workaround. Adding a property to specify LEDs usage to 
the PHY DT node shouldn't be difficult, but associating that node to the PHY 
device and handling the property in the PHY driver will require a bit of work. 
Is this on your to-do list ?
