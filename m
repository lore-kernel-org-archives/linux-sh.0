Good idea, I have no objections against DT binding documentation. So
if future versions end up using DT then those bindings surely need to
be documented.

The reason behind using DT here is that it was recommended to me
during the review of an earlier SMP prototype version. The base
addresses for the Renesas-specific APMU hardware needs to be
configured somehow and using DT may not be such a bad idea.

Thanks for this information. I'm not really trying to do any custom
multi-cluster power management here, only provide software support for
our APMU hardware block. The APMU hardware block is used in several
SoCs from Renesas - for instance in single-cluster CA15-only
configurations or multi-cluster CA15 and CA7 configurations.

So regardless of PSCI or MPCM it seems to me that the APMU hardware
needs to be supported somewhere. I would like to have the APMU
software support in Linux to follow the same style as our other SoCs.
Having dependencies on binary blobs is something that I would like to
avoid unless it is absolutely necessary. Regarding secure vs
non-secure mode, as you may have guessed by now - the hardware on my
desk runs in non-secure mode.

As for PSCI, I wonder how that is supposed to work when power domains
are shared between I/O devices and CPUs? I can understand the benefits
of using PSCI to share independent CPU core PM support code outside of
Linux if multiple OS would be supported perhaps together with TOS. But
if there is no TOS and only a single OS and/or the hardware power
domains include CPU cores and I/O devices driven by the OS then the
merits of PSCI become less clear to me.

Yes, thanks, reusing that code sounds like a good plan.
