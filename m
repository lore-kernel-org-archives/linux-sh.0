Generally, calling pm_runtime_get_sync() in ->probe() and expecting the
driver's ->runtime_resume() to be always be invoked is a mistake.  I know
nothing about any guarantees that this will always happen.

If you want your ->runtime_resume() to be invoked no matter what, you really
need to figure out what the current state of things is, change it to your
expectations with runtime PM disabled and enable runtime PM after that. 

Still, that also needs to be done with care as the bus type/PM domain may be
affected by it.

First off, it's not a bug in the runtime PM core, as that code is agnostic
to what should or should not happen to devices during ->probe, ->remove etc.

Second, as I said above (and elsewhere), the driver is just a piece of the
puzzle in many cases.
