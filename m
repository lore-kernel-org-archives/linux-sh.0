The patch looks good, just like the rest of the series, but there is
one aspect that I think would make sense to clean up at the same time,
since you are already touching all those lines:

The slave_id/chan_priv values are now passed three times into the
driver, and one should really be enough. I'd suggest removing the
integer fields from both tmio_mmc_dma and tmio_mmc_data (added in
patch 9), and instead pass it as a void* argument only to tmio_mmc_data.

The alignment_shift and dma_rx_offset values seem to always be
the same for all users (at least the remaining ones, possibly there
were others originally), so you could hardcode those in tmio_mmc_dma.c
and remove the tmio_mmc_dma structure entirely.

The filter pointer should always be passed in the same structure
as the 'void *chan_priv' argument that is used when calling it, so
that would go into tmio_mmc_data as well if you add the data there.

Alternatively you could keep the tmio_mmc_dma structure and fill
it from the platform, but then only have the filter and void* arguments
in it.

For some obscure reason, the 'pdata->dma->slave_id_?x' fields currently
get passed into cfg.slave_id, which is something we really want to
get rid of so we can remove the slave_id field from dma_slave_config:
The slave ID is generally considered specific to the channel allocation,
not the configuration, and not all dmaengine drivers can express it
as a single integer, so the concept is obsolete. When you remove
the slave_id_?x fields here, you should also be able to just remove
the cfg.slave_id assignment without any replacement, unless there is
a bug in the dmaengine driver that should be fixed instead.
