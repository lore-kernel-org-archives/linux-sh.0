lib/string.c contains a lot of stuff that are not needed in preboot, and
would increase the kernel image size.  I'm not sure if we will be able
to make it usable in pre-boot and only bringing in what is needed by
preboot, withtut unnecessarily complicated lib/string.c.

Thanks Joe for the suggestion.  I guess we could remove the #ifndef by
renaming all arch specific mem helper functions to arch_<name>, and
declaring them with a weak attribute in mem.c and let the mem.c check to
see if it is provided, Here is an example for memcpy

Architecture specific,

void *arch_memcpy(void *__dest, __const void *__src, size_t __n)
{
...
}


lib/mem.c

extern void *arch_memcpy(void *__dest, __const void *__src, size_t __n)
__attribute __((weak));

void *memcpy(void *__dest, __const void *__src, size_t __n)
{
        if (arch_memcpy) {
		arch_memcpgoogly();
		return;	
	}

}

But this does not solve the memmove issue. Could we always trust
arch_memcpy in all architectures?  I guess the safest way would be to
use memmove in string.c.  Please let me know if you have any thoughts or
suggestions.

Thanks,
Mak.
