These are the first two common patches in my series to introduce
sparsemem support to RISC-V. The full series was posted last cycle
here [1] and the latest version can be found here [2].

As recommended by Palmer, I'd like to get the changes to common code
merged and then I will pursue the cleanups in the individual arches (arm,
arm64, and sh) as well as add the new feature to riscv.

I would suggest we merge these two patches through Andrew's mm tree.

Thanks,

Logan

Changes in v2:
 * Added a comment documenting the awkwardly named memblocks_present()
   function, as suggested by Andrew.

  mm: Introduce common STRUCT_PAGE_MAX_SHIFT define
  mm/sparse: add common helper to mark all memblocks present
