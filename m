DEBUG_LL is meant for low-level debugging, and may not work well
if multiple platforms/SoCs are enabled.
If your kernel only has support for r8a7790/r8a7791, the default value
of CONFIG_DEBUG_UART_PHYS should be OK.
Else, ... well, you already noticed you can still change the address
when configuring.

Does enable CONFIG_EARLY_PRINTK help?

Thanks for testing!
