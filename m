Hi Morimoto-san,

Thanks for your patch. Good to see that you're adding support for
external IRQs and the SMSC chip. I would like to merge the actual
hardware support code right away, but it I have some comments on this
patch and I believe you will have to rework patches and resend. Please
see below for more information.

Uhm, there is a certain contradiction between your change log message
and the diffstat. =)

This patch is actually adding lines of code instead of saving lines, no?

Thanks for trying to improve the situation, but I must confess that I
don't like this. Basically, if you want to improve something related
to platform device registration then this must to happen on a higher
level like for instance modifying the generic platform device
registration code base. So making this optimization in
mach-shmobile/include/mach/common.h will just lead to mach-shmobile
including special non-standard code that becomes difficult to read for
people. There is no point in being special.

As you notice, these lines above increase the number of lines of code
in this file. I prefer first of all being standard, and after that
going the other direction to asmaller code base. =)

Why do you want to use platform_device_register_full() for all cases
when you instead can use different functions case-by-case?

For instance, you can use platform_device_register_simple() or
platform_device_register_data() or platform_device_register_resndata()
depending on what kind of device you are registering.

So please drop the special macros introduced by this patch.

Next time please consider submitting patches in a different order. I
would prefer the following:
[PATCH 01/03] ARM: shmobile: r8a7778: add r8a7778_init_irq_extpin()
[PATCH 02/03] ARM: shmobile: bockw: add SMSC ethernet support
[PATCH 03/03] ARM: shmobile: define PLATFORM_xxx_INFO()

If you put the cleanup patch as final portion it is easy to compare
saved number of lines. Also, if we disagree about your macro then it
is easy to only merge 1 and 2.

So because of the existing patch order in this series I am afraid I
will have to ask you to resend patch 2/3 and 3/3 without using special
macros like PLATFORM_xxxx_INFO().

Thanks for your help!
