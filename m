Hmm, Will tells me that later ARM cores can migrate dirty cache lines up
the cache tree, which means that we're potentially into deep problems
with CPU hotplug and suspend paths, because it means there's potentially
no way to ensure that we cleanly push data out the caches and shut the
caches down before the CPU goes down.

Combine this cache behaviour with the implementation specific details
about SCTRL.C (whether caches are just prevented from being allocated,
or whether it also affects the caches being searched) and you have a
recipe for multiple chunks of complex platform specific and CPU
specific code - especially when combined with things like removal of
CPU power and synchronisation of that in the hotplug case.

I do hope that ARM Ltd have thought about this, and have a way that we
can shut CPU caches down sanely, but I'm fearing that they haven't
really considered that to be something anyone really wants to do in a
generic way.
