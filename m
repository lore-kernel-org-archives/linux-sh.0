Note that there's a space missing between the name and email in these
tags (and for Deepthi's below also.)  That seems to exist in all the
patches.

For my Reviewed-by, it only applies to the core code and the OMAP
changes.  I haven't reviewed the other platform-specific drivers.  I
believe the same applies to Jean Pihet who works with me on OMAP.

Looks like you never heard from anyone actively working on at91,
shmobile, kirwood or davinci.

I'm not sure we should merge those platform-specific changes without an
ack from those platform maintainers.

For 3.4, maybe we should just merge the core code and the platforms that
have been reviewed/ack'd, and for 3.5, spent some time nagging the other
platform maintainers to review and test.
