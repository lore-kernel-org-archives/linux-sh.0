I don't think this is a critical error.
The bridge works fine after an attempt to access the unsupported PCIe/PCI-X 2 area.

If you want to prevent the access, I'm OK with it.
But I think it's better to do "if (where <= 0x100)"
and drop the slot check since all other slots do not support
access beyond 0x100 as well.

The PCI code attempts to access beyond 0x100 only once when probing PCI bridges
to see if they support PCIe/PCI-X 2 area which is 4K.
The area beyond 0x40 is never accessed because the bridge does not expose any PCI capabilities.

Did you experience any problems other than this message
printed by the IRQ handler introduced by the previous patch?
