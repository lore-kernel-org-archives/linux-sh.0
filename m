Before time_init(), sched_clock() currently returns 0 with the
architected timers (though I don't particularly like this for arm64).
Marc Rutland has patches to make arch_timer_read_counter() a function
which always returns the virtual counter. It requires the CNTVOFF
register to be set to 0 on AArch32 during boot. But this way
sched_clock() on arm64 would always return meaningful values as we have
the architected timers.
