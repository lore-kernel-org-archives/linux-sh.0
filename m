Hi Olof, Hi Kevin, Hi Arnd,

Please consider these Renesas ARM based SoC clock fixes for v3.18.
Or alternatively for v3.19 if you feel they are too late for v3.18.


* ARM: shmobile: r8a7740 legacy: Add missing INTCA clock for irqpin module

  This problem appears to have been introduced when the r8a7740 started
  using the irqpin driver, a change made by 0b7d7820226016205 ("ARM:
  shmobile: r8a7740: Migrate from INTC to GIC") in v3.9.
  It may well have existed in a different form before then.

  It is my understanding that the problem problem only manifests if
  uboot does not start the clock: in practice it does.

* ARM: shmobile: r8a7740 legacy: Correct IIC0 parent clock

  This problem appears to have been introduced when IIC0 support was
  added to the r8a7740 by commit 6c01ba445cecb2d8 ("ARM: mach-shmobile:
  R-Mobile A1 support.") in v3.3.

  I am not aware of any run-time effect of this problem.

* ARM: shmobile: r8a7790: Fix SD3CKCR address

  This problem was introduced when div6 clock support was added to the
  r8a7790 by 46632512c4b6ed9d5 ("ARM: shmobile: r8a7790: add div6 clocks")
  in v3.10.

  As there is no SD card slot for SDHI3 on the lager board there is no
  run-time effect of this problem on boards supported in mainline.
