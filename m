Hi Ben,

I have looked at the mmc patches, those looks good to me. Regarding
the pinctrl and ARM patches, I suppose these can be taken through
their respective trees and I can take the mmc patches?

BTW, I noticed that the pinctrl maintainer wasn't in the to-field, you
may need to repost.

Kind regards
Uffe
