You've had these posted for quite a while, so I've pushed them to
mmc-next for 3.6 now.  It would still be good to get some reviews on
them, though -- reviewers, feel free to continue to look at these and
I'll add your Reviewed-by tags (and the updates to the patches if
necessary) as they come in.

Thanks!

- Chris.
