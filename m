For internal tree purposes, does .set_termios need to be atomic? Can it 
grab mutexes instead of spinlock?

Going back to the topic, how about CPU freq drivers possibly using 
clk_set_rate() to change freq? Do you think that's not the case or a 
concern?

All,

Do any one of your mach's control CPU freq using clk_set_rate() and does 
it need to be atomic? CPUfreq doesn't need it to be atomic. So, you will 
need clk_set_rate() to be atomic only if you try to use it to lower CPU 
freq very late during idle/suspend.
