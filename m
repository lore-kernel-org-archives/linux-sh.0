It is unlikely we'll ever add this support, because the GIC doesn't not
have that capability in HW (wake-up is not even part of the
architecture). This is why wake up is always left to some other
interrupt controller.

At the moment, your approach will work, but only because we have another
bug, as described here:

http://lkml.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/1501.1/04757.html

Fixing this bug means we will propagate the flag to be visible at the
top level of the controller hierarchy, which will cause any
irq_set_irq_wake() request to be ignored. Probably not what people have
mind.

Only the platform code knows the topology of the system, unfortunately.

When it comes to the message you describe above, I'd blame the driver:
irq_set_irq_wake() does return -ENXIO when there is no irq_set_wake
method. The driver should definitely test this, avoid doing a wake
disable if the enable has failed.

Thanks,
