I thought historically NULL tended to mean it did not care about
this.

The whole thing is giving me a headache as I would expect the
suspend to start with device and then work down the layers and
resume to do the opposite. However currently rpm_resume will also
start at the dev->pm_domain.

Should the rpm_resume start with the dev->bus->pm and then work
its way up to the dev->driver->pm callback? If so then the current
davinci code is also going to be wrong...
