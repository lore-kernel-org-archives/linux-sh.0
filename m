I kept them together as adding the PM domain without the devices will
cause regressions (the PM domain core will power down the PM domain as
it doesn't know about the to-be-added devices, and thus thinks it's unused).

As the link from a device to a PM domain is a name string, and not a
C reference, I could split them in two parts: first the board part
that adds some
devices, and then the SoC part that adds the PM domain and more devices.
But only if you can guarantee that the SoC part will be merged first, also
by arm-soc and Linus.

Still, I prefer to keep them together. Hooking up devices to PM domains is
SoC-specific, not board specific (for DT it lives in the .dtsi). It's
unfortunate this code is in the board-specific C files due to board-specific
configuration (cfr. .dts overriding/extending .dtsi).

What do you think? Do you agree?

Thanks!
