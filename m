Please write the binding in a way that does not refer to a specific
implementation in Linux: The binding should describe the hardware
independent of details in the driver. In particular, I think you
should not refer to the TMIO_MMC_BLKSZ_2BYTES etc macros but describe
in text what the flags are about.

Regarding the toshiba,mmc-wrprotect-disable property, would it be
enough to just check the presence of the wp-gpios property?

TMIO_MMC_BLKSZ_2BYTES seems to be set unconditionally in
sh_mobile_sdhi_probe and nowhere else, so I'd assume we don't
actually need to provide this here, but can keep that knowledge
implicit based on whether we're talking to sh_mobile_sdhi
or another tmio_mmc variant.

For the other last one, is that actually board specific, or just
a feature of a given chip? If we can tell by the SoC, then I'd
suggest using separate "compatible" properties instead, and
put a bitmask of features into the .data field of the of match
table. For all I can tell, SH7372 does not set it, while SH73A0,
R8A7740 and R8A7779 always do.
