It's great that you work on fixing this issue, thank you.

In the long run I wonder if it's best to try to get rid of the
MAX_XRES/MAX_YRES stuff from the LCDC driver. I understand that you
need to allocate the frame buffer memory early on, but it would be
much better if the maximum values could be kept in platform data. The
maximum resolution varies with CPU type, so a one-for-all modification
like this may break older platforms.

Thanks,
