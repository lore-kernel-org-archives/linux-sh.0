... which will mean the platforms at the simpler end of the spectrum
will ignore it because it'll be far too heavy weight for them.

If we're going to do something generic with it, then we need something
that _can_ scale from damned simple right up to OMAP-type complex.  We
don't want to start with something OMAP-type complex and have everyone
use it even for just one or two (or even 30 simple enable/disable
non-tree like) clocks.  And those platforms should not have to have
several K of unused code in their kernel because of it.

Otherwise, we'll just end up going back to people trying to directly
access clock mask registers from drivers.

Note that because of the develtech.com fuckup, I don't have your patch
series because I had to drop off the lists for about six hours to stop
the deluge of emails.
