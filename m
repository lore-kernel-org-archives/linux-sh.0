I don't think we need a total of 3 different config options for the
platform device pm stuff, but I do think it makes sense to handle the
platform archdata separately. Not sure which is the best way though,
the #ifdefery is not very pretty. Maybe the best solution is just to
drop the Kconfig stuff and add empty structures to all architecture
versions of asm/device.h.

Any suggestions?

Thanks!
