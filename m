Subject: [PATCH 3/3] ARM: shmobile: r8a7790: fix shdi resource sizes

From: Ben Dooks <ben.dooks@codethink.co.uk>

The r8a7790.dtsi file has four sdhi nodes which the first two have the wrong
resource size for their register block. This causes the sh_modbile_sdhi driver
to fail to communicate with card at-all.

Change sdhi{0,1} node size from 0x100 to 0x200 to correct these nodes
as per Kuninori Morimoto's response to the original patch where all four
nodes where changed. sdhi{2,3} are the correct size.

This bug has been present since sdhi resources were added to the r8a7790 by
8c9b1aa41853272a ("ARM: shmobile: r8a7790: add MMCIF and SDHI DT
templates") in v3.11-rc2.
