I see several main reasons why DT bindings need time to stabilize.

- When implementing support for currently unsupported features of the device 
we could realize that the bindings were designed in a way that makes support 
of new features difficult in a backward-compatible way.

- When a new SoC comes out we could realize that device features or SoC 
integration parameters that we thought were set in stone are actually not, and 
don't play well with the current bindings.

- When other vendors implement bindings for similar devices we could realize 
that common needs would benefit from common bindings.

At least the last reason advocates for experimental DT bindings being 
committed to the mainline kernel, to make it possible for developers to 
identify common needs between vendors.

In this specific case I'm mostly concerned about the first reason, as I don't 
expect our new SoCs to come out with a CPG nearly-but-not-quite-identical to 
the r8a7740's. The stabilization time would thus depend entirely on our effort 
to implement support for the currently missing features. Integration with MSTP 
is the main one (the overlapping register ranges problem I've mentioned before 
is a good example, even if it doesn't cause a real problem today), and support 
for at least some of the missing clocks would be good as well. If we actively 
maintain this driver I expect that one or two kernel releases should be enough 
for the bindings to stabilize.

Please feel free to also discuss the other reasons I've mentioned above and 
how you would like to see them being handled.
