Hi,

this is an update of a series posted by Ulrich,
"ARM: shmobile: various DT files sorted by address",
the purpose of which is to sort DT nodes by their address.

Changes since v1.
* Drop patch reo remove spurious regulator base address as it
  gave two nodes the same name. Until better names be found just
  use the existing scheme (this series don't add the names it just
  moves the nodes).

Changes since v1.
* Some patches from the v1 series have been queued up and thus are not
  present in v2.
* Two new patches have been added to remove spurious regulator base
  addresses, as suggested by Geert Uytterhoeven. These correct incorrect
  lines before subsequent patches, rebased since v1, move them.

Based on renesas-next-20140918-v3.17-rc2
Targeted for inclusion in v3.19.
