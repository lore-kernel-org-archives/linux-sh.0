Ok, I see. If you think it's not likely to be ready for 3.12, we might
need to discuss again whether there is another way of making the
common clk and the sh-clk code coexist. For instance, we could rename
all if the sh/shmobile specific clk functions and their users from
clk_* to shclk_*, and provide a thin wrapper around them that integrates
into common clk.

We have had a few that were able to do both multiplatform and
single-platform for some time, but then changed to multiplatform-only.
I think mvebu and vt8500 are in this category.

Yes, makes sense.

What I think you should do is rename CONFIG_ARCH_SHMOBILE to
CONFIG_ARCH_SHMOBILE_SINGLE, and add a new symbol in
arch/arm/mach-shmobile/Kconfig like

config ARCH_SHMOBILE
	bool "Renesas SH-Mobile / R-Mobile" if ARCH_MULTI_V6_V7
	default CONFIG_ARCH_SHMOBILE_SINGLE
        help
          Support for Renesas's SH-Mobile and R-Mobile ARM platforms.

This way, the platform is a non-exclusive option for the multiplatform
case, and a hidden enabled option when building CONFIG_ARCH_SHMOBILE_SINGLE.
Every machine that is not ready for multiplatform can then add "depends on
CONFIG_ARCH_SHMOBILE_SINGLE".
