Spaghetti-O's? =) I agree that some special handling is needed.

Yeah, it seems that interface isn't such a good match. Thanks.

Thanks for listing these. I have come across another option:

Use of_update_property() and of_property_read_u32() to pass using a
property, see below.

Yeah, I too would be interested to hear what Mike thinks about this matter.

Please see below for a prototype patch on top of your code that shows
the driver side of my DT property proposal. The omitted SoC side
becomes slightly more complicated but that code can be shared between
multiple R-Car SoCs so I think it should be acceptable size-wise.

With this patch applied the interface between the driver and the SoC
code is a DT property (that needs documentation) and
of_clk_init(NULL). No more evil link time symbol dependencies between
arch/ and drivers/...
