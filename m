Like I said, it's fine with me if your DTS process relies on
checkpatch, and I'm not suggesting any other tool.

I'm just trying to get clarity on the nitty-gritty technical benefits
of this patch, and I think it is "this patch enables people to add a
DTS containing 'renesas,pcie-r8a7793' to the kernel source without
having checkpatch complain."

If the convention is that OEMs can't ship a DT unless it's in the
kernel source and has passed checkpatch, that's fine, but it can't be
enforced by a kernel patch.
