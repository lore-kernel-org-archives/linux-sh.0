I'm not sure about this. A typical use case would be to gate clocks ASAP 
and then wait until device is idle long enough to consider turning off 
the power domain worthwhile. Also sometimes we may want to gate the 
clocks, but prevent power domain from being powered off to retain 
hardware state (e.g. because there is no way to read it and restore later).

I believe, though, that for devices that are not inside a controllable 
power domain, this might be a good solution.
