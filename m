I don't understand how the changeset comment relates to the patch.

As far as I know, all architectures are required to have the same barrier
semantics on readw and ioread16. The only difference between the two is
that ioread16 must be able top operate on an __iomem token returned by
ioport_map() or pci_iomap, which readw does not have to, but does on ARM.

Same thing here: both readsw and ioread16_rep are supposed to do the same
thing, and I would assume that they should also include that barrier.
For some reason I don't understand, they do not have the barrier on
ARM at the moment, but I cannot say whether that is intentional or not.

Maybe Russell can comment on this.

Also, should the barrier not be /after/ the MMIO read, rather than before it?
Typically the barrier should ensure that any read from memory after an
MMIO read reflects the memory contents after any DMA is complete that
the MMIO read has already claimed to be done.

Similarly here: why do you have the wmb after the iowrite rather than before it?
