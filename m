Subject: [PATCH 12/12] ARM: shmobile: r8a7790: Correct SYS DMAC clock defines
Message-Id: <74b9ba5f35fbd071f313781498a9e244bcc6f03e.1392278855.git.horms+renesas@verge.net.au>

This brings the implementation into line with the documentation.

This problem was introduced when SYS DMAC clock defines were added by
ac991dce6498b5fc ("ARM: shmobile: r8a7790: Add clock index macros for DT
sources") in v3.13-rc2. I do not believe this results in any problems as
these defines do not appear to be used anywhere yet.
