    Do you get NFS timeout(s) on booting? I do. It's a known issue.

    Hm, that I didn't see...

    That's one way to deal with the issue, but it's not quite correct because 
it'll make Ether LEDs function in a way not matching to the intended one.
I've added PHY platform fixup to force the LED mode to the intended one after 
PHY reset that the driver does. I've also submitted a somewhat naive patch to 
call the fixups after that PHY reset but it got refused by David Miller. 
That's why we have what we have now. Hopefully, this should get resolved in 
3.14 if Florian Fainelli's patch series gets accepted:

    You can try my simplistic 'sh_eth' driver patch:
