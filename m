Hi Ryan,

This would be fairly evident on first boot though :)

Yes, sounds good. I was hesitant to change the documentation for parts of the 
API that are unchanged, but since we're formalising this 'return 0' behaviour, 
it seems reasonable to update the comment in this case.

That may never happen; I imagine that some platforms won't be converted at 
all.

 __clk_get has previously been used as a platform-specific hook to do 
refcounting, which is exactly what we're doing here (via ops->get), so thought 
it was best to use the existing __clk_get name to do this.

Yep, makes sense, I'll look at doing this.

OK, I'll clarify the comment.

Cheers,
