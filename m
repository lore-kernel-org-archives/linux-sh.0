Hi,

I'm stopping my merges for the night here, so I haven't merged this but I'll
likely do it tomorrow. I did have comments on one of the patches though (that
adds a new include/mach file that's not really needed). Fixing that can be done
incrementally though, especially if you have downstream users of this branch.
