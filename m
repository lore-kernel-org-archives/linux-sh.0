Agree. This patch as is will break such platforms.
As possible solution for above problem - the NULL can be used as clock's prefix
by default and platform code can configure new value of clock's prefix during
initialization.
In addition, to make this solution full the of_clk_get_by_name() will
need to be modified too.

But note pls, this is pure RFC patches which I did to find out the answer on questions:
- What is better: maintain Runtime PM clocks configuration in DT or in code?

- Where and when to call of_clk_register_runtime_pm_clocks()?
  Bus notifier/ platform core/ device drivers

Also, May be platform dependent solution [1] can be acceptable for now?
