About new flags.

FB_VISUAL_* specifies how pixel values (which may be tuples) are mapped to
colors on the screen, so to me it looks like the sensible way to set up YCbCr.

Yep, FB_TYPE_* specifies how pixel values/tuples are laid out in frame buffer
memory.

FB_AUX_* is only used if a specific value of FB_TYPE_* needs an additional
parameter (e.g. the interleave value for interleaved bitplanes).
Another possible use is the offset between the even and odd fields of
the screen,
for hardware that supports interlacing by storing the even and odd
fields separately.
I think I even posted patches for that several years ago... Indeed
