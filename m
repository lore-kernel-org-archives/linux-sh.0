Have a look at the code in tmio_mmc_host_suspend() for some code that
does struct device * -> struct tmio_mmc_host *:
int tmio_mmc_host_suspend(struct device *dev)
{
	struct mmc_host *mmc =3D dev_get_drvdata(dev);
	struct tmio_mmc_host *host =3D mmc_priv(mmc);

You can easily change the dev_get_drvdata() to platform_get_drvdata(),
see include/linux/platform_device.h

I guess a similar conversion can be done in tmio_mmc_enable_dma() to
move from writew() to sd_ctrl_write16()?
