Currently we have the clock controller in the DTS. It only lacks a few clocks
(like INTC-SYS -> GIC).

Don't worry, I have early boot code that disables all non-critical clocks.
This already caught many bugs (missing clock handling). It also caused a
bug, as I missed an interrupt storm due to a disabled clock ;-)

Thanks!

  - R-Mobile APE6 (r8a73a4):        GICD_IIDR reports 0x0200043b
  - R-Car Gen M2-W (r8a7791):       GICD_IIDR reports 0x0200043b

        ProductID = 0x02 (GIC-400)
        Variant = 0x0
        Revision = 0x0
        Implementer = 0x43b (ARM)

So both are GIC-400 (in the mean time I found a reference to GIC-400 in
the APE6 docs).

I also ran it on a few other SoCs:

  - SH-Mobile AG5 (sh73a0):         GICD_IIDR reports 0x0102043b

        Implementation version = 0x01 (Cortex-A9 MPCore)
        Revision number = 0x020
        Implementer = 0x43b (ARM)

    Which GIC is that?

  - R-Mobile A1 (r8a7740):          GICD_IIDR reports 0x0000043b

        ProductID = 0x00 (GIC-500 or Cortex-A15 MPCore or PL390)
        Variant = 0x0
        Revision = 0x0
        Implementer = 0x43b (ARM)

    Seems like 0x0000043b can mean multiple things. Docs say PL390 r0p0.

No need for the cast.

Perhaps just

        pr_debug("GICD_IIDR reports 0x%08lx\n",
                 readl_relaxed(gic_data_dist_base(gic) + GIC_DIST_IIDR));

?
