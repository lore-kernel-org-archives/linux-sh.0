Sorry to join the discussion late, was on vacation, travel, long
weekend...

I don't still comprehend the need for a library on top of dmaengine
which gain is just a library between clients and dmacs. Surely we don't
want to write another abstraction on top of one provided?

If the question is to handle scatter-gather even if the hardware doesn't
have the capability, then why don't add that in dmaengine itself rather
than one more layer?
