Been there, got bitten. We only found out too late, because one driver
was in i2c and the other in GPIO (or LED even?), both using "953x" :(

I do prefer this:

1) add specific compatible values to the driver. We do those updates for
new devices all the time
2) also add "34x" as a compatible but mark it as deprecateed
3) delete "34x" from trivial devices

Everyone OK with that?

Thanks,
