Yes, there is, or more precisely there's going to be shortly.  We have
PM domains on SH7372 and when we enable all of them to be powered off
at run time, there will be many power states for the controller which
is located in one of them.  Hence the $subject patch. :-)

Well, this isn't a timeout.  Have you read my reply to Linus?

I agree that it should be configurable _eventually_, but no one seems to
know how to implement that configurability.  Ideally, that value should
result from some user space input, possibly after a conversion by the
driver to a useful number, but we don't seem to have any agreement as to
what the interface for passing that user space input to the driver should
look like.

I'll leave this one to Guennadi, if you don't mind. :-)

OK, that's a valid concern.  This means there should be a way for user space
to specify the constraint somehow, because it's a user space's role to define
policies.

You're right.

Good point.

Thanks,
