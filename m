Hi Kevin, Hi Olof, Hi Arnd,

please consider these Renesas ARM based SoC updates for v3.14.

As discussed elsewhere, this pull-request also includes defconfig changes
related to renaming ARCH_SHMOBILE to ARCH_SHMOBILE_LEGACY. These are also
to avoid build regressions when using defconfigs

As this pull request is based on v3.12, which does not include
genmai_defconfig, it has not been updated. Rather, I have queued up a patch
in my defconfig to switch it to use ARCH_SHMOBILE_LEGACY.  This does
involve breaking that defconfig. However as it is new and not in
wide-spread use it seems better to live with that temporary breakage than
to have soc depend on defconfig (as was the case in the previous version of
this pull request).
