I am using the same kernel image.
I wonder if it is an MSTP issue.

Looking over the datasheet I see:

For the r8a779[0-4] Thermal in MSTPSR5, RMSTPCR5.
I.e. there is a bit for thermal in those registers for all R-Car Gen-2
SoCs covered by the datasheet.

But only on the r8a779[0-3] I see thermal in SRCR5, SRSTCLR5.
I.e. there is no bit for thermal in those registers for the r8a7794
which is different from the other R-Car Gen-2 SoCs covered by the datasheet.
