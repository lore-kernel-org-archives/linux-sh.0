Thanks for your comments. As you probably saw in patch 00/06, the goal
with this series is to remove CONFIG_MEMORY_START/SIZE from
mach-shmobile.

I myself am quite happy to keep on using the kernel configuration to
describe the main memory window like today, this is exactly how we
used to do it on SH as well. What is a bit difficult is that we for
mach-shmobile are requested to consolidate the kernel configurations
and move to CONFIG_MULTIPLATFORM.

My main concern is that I'd like to keep per-board memory
configuration somewhere, just removing it seems like a regression in
usefulness to me. Do you have any recommendation for me how to
proceed?

Thanks,
