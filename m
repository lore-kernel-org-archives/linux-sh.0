Indeed.  The interrupt controller is basically the first device to be
activated in the life of the system, and I can see a nasty chicken and
egg problem creeping up if you're trying to do clock management in a
generic way at that level.

As long as there is an agreement from the DT people on the presence of
that extra property in the GIC node, I'm happy with that. I'd like it to
be documented though.
