To clarify - I didn't write that code.  It was developed by some of the 
Kernel guys over at Renesas Japan specifically for my request to support 
SDIO under their BSP for 2.6.33.  The code in tmio and sh_mobile_sdhi 
replaces a previously closed source module for SD support on the hardware 
due to licensing restrictions of the SD consortium.  Apparently those issues 
were resolved and now the complete SD stack is integrated into the Kernel 
directly.  However, the transition didn't include support for SDIO, so the 
patch to tmio was provided in the interim.

Magnus - Do you know the author for the SDIO patch?
