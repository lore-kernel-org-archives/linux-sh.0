Thanks. Actually, it recently occurred to me, that patches 3 and 10 should 
actually be merged into one. So, if you like, I can produce a v3 with that 
taken into account. The result would be exactly the same, I literally 
would just apply #10 on top of #3 and commit the result with the same 
commit description as the v2 of #3.

Shall I also rebase v3 on top of mmx-next and fix the failing patch? The 
two ARM patches can be applied separately, but they have to go in after 
this series then. Either way is ok with me, pulling all via mmc has the 
advantage of not having to synchronise the pulls, but then the conflict 
probability rises of course.

Thanks
