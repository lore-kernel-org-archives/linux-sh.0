Why do we need to turn on the clock in the IRQ? Why not defer it to a 
workqueue (or whatever is the method of the day to defer work from an 
IRQ)? The advantage of doing the clk_enable in the IRQ should be 
negligible compared to the time it takes to do the DMA.

In my opinion, the only major reason for needing atomic clk APIs was due 
to device_ops->suspend being atomic. Since that's not the case anymore, 
I really don't see a justification for atomic clocks. Sure, I might have 
missed some exceptions, but in that case we should make the atomic APIs 
an exception (add clk_enable_atomic) and not the norm.
