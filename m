This clock management code is identical to the one in pm-rmobile.c.
We may consolidate in the future, if we have more PM Domain support (e.g.
for R-Car Gen2 SYSC). Let's see...

Specifying the clocks is indeed the hard part. I use the primary clocks, as
that is compatible with what we did in the past in drivers/sh/pm_runtime.c.
I thought about using a special clock name instead, but that may conflict
with an existing driver-specific DT binding for clk-names, and may cause
problems if you have to specify the same clock twice with different clk-names.

Thanks!
