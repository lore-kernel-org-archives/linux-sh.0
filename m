I don't mean that, sorry, and we can figure out if both of them are worthy =

Right, there is some docs which need to be update or even drop, and a reord=
er would be a timing to push each of arch maintainer to do something, isn't=
 it? Anyway, reordering  documents like kernel source dir could be one of c=
hoices. :)

Thanks for considering, anyway, it could be a good start to get hands dirty=
 whether the arch dir is needed.=20
