First of all, I'm glad to hear that you are positive to our work. This
means a lot to us. I personally agree with the DT direction and to
move things along we are multiple people working on improving both our
own situation (drivers, soc) and infrastructure that everyone in the
kernel community can use (PM, kexec). So I believe we are doing our
fair share there. At the same time we also need to provide some kind
of base code that is working as-is.

Regarding the new boards, you are correct that they are using Cortex
A9. I'm not sure if your policy considers other IP that is tied to the
ARM block, but in our case we have custom interrupt controllers. On
r8a7740 it's a A9 with our INTC used instead of the GIC, and on sh73a0
we make use of the GIC but we have our own cascaded interrupt
controllers. Unfortunately we don't have any long term DT solution
ready. I wrote a prototype myself to get other people started, but the
long term part is still being worked on by Paul Mundt - this since we
share the interrupt controller code with the SH architecture.

I'd be happy to add a DT_MACHINE_START() implementation for each SoC
if that make it easier for you guys to merge our code. From a
usability point of view, I'm quite certain that all our U-boot based
boards take uImages instead of zImage as kernel image format. I prefer
zImage myself, but unfortunately it is not my call.

I believe an uImage on ARM is basically a wrapped zImage.
Unfortunately I have not been able to find some simple way of
including DTB in the uImage. So to be able to use these kernels on our
existing boards that take uImage it seems that I will have to patch
the kernel locally somehow? I am fine using ARM_ATAG_DTB_COMPAT=3Dy
during development - actually it is my preferred way - but I'm not so
comfortable asking our customers to patch their kernel source just to
be able to build an uImage.

Do you have any recommendation for me?

I can check with my superiors if we can phase our sh7367 support. If
so then we have only A8 and A9 in tree which should be easy to support
with a single kernel configuration. Does that sound like something
that would simplify things for you?

Ok. When can we retry?

Thanks,
