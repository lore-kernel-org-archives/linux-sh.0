Hmm... indeed Arnd's patch and my patch-set conflicts.
I have these patch / patch-set
 1) header cleanup for tmio
 2) slave_id cleanup for shdma
 3) add DMA feature for sh_mobile_sdhi

1 ) and 2) conflicts here. one idea is like this
 1) header cleanup for tmio
 2) add DMA feature for sh_mobile_sdhi
 3) slave_id cleanup for shdma

1) and 2) can be controled by Ulf with no-conflict.
if these are merged correctly, I can send 3) to DMAEngine ML.
Then, I can point the Ulf's branch as base branch.

Arnd, Ulf what do you think ?

Best regards
