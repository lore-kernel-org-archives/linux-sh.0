Yeah my bad, I just hit this EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL issue when compiling
oprofile as a module.

I'm not advocating moving this function to asm/perf_event.h.

I don't see why we should pollute the perf namespace with a function
that is only being used inside the SH oprofile code? There would be
exactly one use of this function and I doubt the perf guys will want
this function exposed. In it's current state, it really is no use to any
architecture other than SH.

We can always add a generic perf_pmu_name() function later if needed,
but it's definitely not needed at the moment.
