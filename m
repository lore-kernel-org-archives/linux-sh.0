I have made a limited amount of progress on this trying to create a
defconfig that will work on both the Marzen and Armadillo 800 EVA boards.

* Serial console appears to work, although for the Marzen at
  least enabling earlyprintk seems to require the bootloader to specify
  e.g.  console=ttySC2,115200 earlyprintk

  This is done by fully specifying bootargs in U-Boot.
  The boodloaders on the Marzen board has an ampty bootargs by default.

  I guess I can live without earlyprink by default,
  though it does seem to be a regression in the user experience.

* A more significant problem seems to be the use of CONFIG_MEMORY_START
  to define PLAT_PHYS_OFFSET in arch/arm/mach-shmobile/include/mach/memory.h

  I'm not sure that I see an easy way to get around this one.
