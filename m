Hi Magnus, Hi Wolfram,

could you clarify the status of this patch for me?

I believe it is reverted by "[PATCH V2 4/5] arm: shmobile: genmai: adapt
dts to use native i2c driver".

I'm fine with applying both patches at some point. But perhaps
we can skip some dependencies by just applying a squashed version?
