Sorry for the delay in responding to this.

OK, so you're saying architectures that don't want this constraint can 
make their own macro.  Seems to make this whole exercise slightly less 
useful, but whatever.

I see three ways to go here:

1) Leave it as is.
2) Force all architectures to use a common definition.
3) Provide a common definition that all architectures (except "arm") 
currently using this functionality will use.

I have a v2 patch to implement #3, ready to post.  Do we think this is 
the way to go? I don't like #2 because I really don't want to rename all 
uses of the current register fields for arm since this is 
architecture-specific code to begin with and since it affects code in 39 
arm source files.
