this is a third pass at at providing a refernce DT implementation
for the kzm9g baord which is intended to act as a guide for mach-shmobile
developers.

It provides a minimal setup of the board using as little C code as
possible.

It may be used by selecting CONFIG_MACH_KZM9G_REFERENCE
and using sh73a0-kzm9g-reference.dtb

*** Please note that the clock initialisation shcheme used in
    this series does not currently work with SMP as there
    is a yet to be resolved lock-up in workqueue initialisation.

    Resolving this problem is currently regarded as future-work.

    CONFIG_SMP must be disabled when using this code. ***

Major difference between v2 and v3:
* Allow UP boot to complete by initialiing CMT earlier.
  This is achieved by changing the position of clocsources/
  in drivers/Makefile

Major difference between v1 and v2:
* Drop touchscreen initialisation, it requires INTC
* Drop SDHI initialisation, the driver seems to need some work
* Add extra entries to clock-sh73a0.c:lookups[] and
  remove auxdata. Ultimtely the clocks will be described
  in DT, but the code isn't there yet.
* Drop MMCIF patch, it is not needed if regulators are enabled
* Drop PCF hacks, instead, the series is based on Laruent Pinchart's *
* series: [PATCH v2 00/77] SH pin control and GPIO rework with OF support
* Use shmobile_setup_delay()
