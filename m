Ok, I didn't notice. My initial suggestion was to not put that logic
into the driver but instead specify in the host bridge binding that each
entry in the dma-ranges property has to meet the hardware constraints.

As long as you don't have too much complexity to detect this case, I'm
fine with it either way.

Yes, fair enough. The current version is much simpler, so that's ok.
Just keep it in mind if you run into performance problems. Also, note
that we don't actually support swiotlb on arm32 yet, so your current
code is broken for an PCI DMA master that is not 64-bit capable.
We need swiotlb on arm32 anyway, and that will fix this problem, but
adding the hack I described would also fix it.
