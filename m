I've so far pushed GPIO and pinctrl patches for SH through Simon's tree due to 
the many cross-dependencies between SH arch code and the GPIO and pinctrl 
drivers. As the situation now stabilizes, we could now push the patches 
through their respective subsystem trees.

Simon, Linus, any opinion/preference on that ?

What about replacing that with

  - gpio-ranges: Range of pins managed by the GPIO controller.

Please refer to gpio.txt in this directory for details of gpio-ranges property 
and the common GPIO bindings used by client devices.
