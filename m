Sure, please do point out any other instance.

Russell did improve it a lot. But then Documentation gets not so quick
updates. Yes new users like you can list issues far more easily than others.

Also now commit log provides a very valuable source of why a particular
thing was done.

The  API states that you need to get a channel, then prepare a descriptor
and submit it back. Prepare can be in any order. The submit order is the one
which is run on dmaengine. The submit marks the descriptor as pending.
Typically you should have a pending_list which the descriptor should be
pushed to.

And lastly invoke dma_async_issue_pending() to start the pending ones.

You have the flexibility to prepare descriptors and issue in the order you
like. You can also attach the callback required for descriptors here.

Ah it is not so dark.

if you look closely at dmaengine channel allocation it is only for marking
if channel is privately to be used or for async_tx.
Thus slave devices must set DMA_PRIVATE

History. DMA engine was developed for async_tx. (hence async_tx)

I think most of dmaengine APIs are dmaengine_. the async_ ones are
specifically for async_tx usage.
txd ones are descriptor related.
