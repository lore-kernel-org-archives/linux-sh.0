In this case, there are *three* regulators:

1. External regulator for card power (VDD pin): "vmmc"
2. External regulator for pull-up voltage for the data pins: "vqmmc"
3. Internal regulator for input(?) level on the data pins:
   "vqmmc_ref" (I'm open to suggestions of a better name)

We already do that.

No, we have one of those already.

It isn't.

We don't support UHS-II so we never change the voltage of this
regulator.
