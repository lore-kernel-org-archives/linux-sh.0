Yes, obviously this driver is special and all other keypad drivers are wrong.

It would be interesting to hear why subsys_initcall() was put there in
the first place.

The keypad driver tries to use the I2C bus before the I2C bus driver
is initialized. Isn't that a pretty good reason to change the initcall
order?

So let's hear what other people have to say about this.

Whatever. Let me know which lines you'd like to add and I'll send a V2.
