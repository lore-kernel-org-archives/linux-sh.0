Well, as the email address suggests, I work for Renesas. And since
the ARCH_R7S72100 has up to 10MB internal RAM and can XIP directly from
QSPI Flash, that's a pretty simple BOM.

I also revisted the AXFS file system (that never made it into the
kernel) and like the kernel, required some fixing up.
However, I can get a functioning and usefull ARMv7 system up and
running in under 3MB of total system RAM.
That's got to be worth something to someone ;)


> Everything can be fixed at once with a new linker script.

I do have to agree that a separate linker script would be a cleaner
solution for the section arrangements.
Of course, there are still some other XIP patches needed (like you can't
use text areas as a temporary stack on boot), but the sections are a
pretty logical place to start.
