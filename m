Thanks for the advice. I saw your series :)
Unfortunately, I think, It can't be used as is, because there still no way
 to separate "functional" and "optional" clocks for the device in DT.
So, I'll need to define some sort of "fck-clocks" or "pm-clocks" properties for each device -
but, it seems to be mostly impossible to obtain the approval of such a decision  :(
 (taking into account current state of discussion
  https://lkml.org/lkml/2014/6/12/441).

There no such problems with Gen PD, but, as drawback:
- I have to define one Gen PD per-device.
- some CLK data duplication is present if Driver code need
  to operate with clocks in legacy way (for example to get current
  CLK  frequency).

Actually, I've done RFC implementation already and I hope to post it soon.
My DT looks like:
+               netcp_domain: netcp_pm_controller {
+                       compatible = "ti,keystone-pm-controller";
+                       clocks = <&clkpa>, <&clkcpgmac>, <&chipclk12>;
+                       #power-domain-cells = <0>;
+               };
+
                netcp: netcp@2090000 {
                        reg = <0x2620110 0x8>;
                        reg-names = "efuse";

By the way, looks like you did the same thing as I:
I've hacked cock_ops, You - Generic PD ;P
but the goal is the same - add hooks for platform's specific initialization code
to workaround imperfection of clock_ops framework :)
