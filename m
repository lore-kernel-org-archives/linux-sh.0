As a _general_ guidline I find smaller patches more pleasant than 
bigger;-) but if you really see an important advantage in moving these 
structs around - I can live with that too:-)

Even there I'm not quite sure about - I do remember having to fiddle with 
the Makefiles to change the probe order, which followed the linkage order. 
Could be, that this has changed since I last checked, but I'd really 
double-check this.
