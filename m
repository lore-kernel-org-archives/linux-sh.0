    R8A7779 support has appeared first in Linux and as R8A7778 Ether is 
identical to R8A7779 and no wildcards are allowed in the device tree, I 
decided to use this "compatible" prop.

    I think R8A7778 and R8A7779 EtherMACs are identical. I've cross checked 
the documentation at the start of the development and the registers appeared 
to be the same.
