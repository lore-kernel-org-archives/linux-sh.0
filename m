I'm not focused on Fedora here (i brought it up as an example). I'd 
like to improve upstream, and if that is done Fedora can just go use 
it and symlink /dev/mem to /dev/crash.

If you make it a read-only thing then that removes many of the 
negative aspects of this feature.

Also, does Xorg really need the first 1MB truly write-mapped? Last i 
checked it needed it for the BIOS ...

So we could kill multiple birds with the same stone here:

 - remove various ugly uses of /dev/mem (including the rootkit usage),
   with or without strict-devmem

 - extending it to above-4G for inspection purposes

 - allowing to kill /dev/mem access runtime similar to the 
   disable_modules lock-down killswitch, for the so inclined.

Would you be interested in modifying your patch-set in such a 
fashion?

Thanks,

	Ingo
