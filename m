Agreed.

So,  what is the main objection to using PM domains for this?  Is it
only a terminology issue?

Exactly, this is real power of this abstraction when used fully.

IMO, a clear win.

As a regular reviewer of PM code for SoCs that I'm not familiar with,
this is another big win from my perspective.
