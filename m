Hi Kevin, Hi Olof, Hi Arnd,

please consider this third round of Renesas ARM based SoC DT updates for v3.12.

It is based on renesas-dt2-for-v3.12 ("Second round of ARM based SoC DT
updates for v3.12") which you have previously pulled.

I apologise that this and other pull requests that I will send today
are rather later in the cycle than I would like. This is primarily due
to a combination of my summer vacation and wanting to let the patches
sit in next for a while.

The following changes since commit 8b3e32c1fe5dce55e28e76b20361841dc863ec17:
