If you (Magnus?) can live with non-working resume from s2ram for now,
it can be queued for v3.19.

I don't think I can improve on the HDMI fix without getting docs and spending
(much) time to get HDMI working on Armadillo.

The hw_breakpoint fix has to be replaced by something better/acceptable,
I'm working on that.
