I don't think the rules for the compatible property are up in the air;
they've been pretty well communicated since at least the start of my
involvement in DT perhaps 2 years ago.

Yes.

I think this has been well covered in the rest of the thread, but if the
IP block doesn't have a version independent from the SoC itself (because
the SoC is developed as a whole, rather than being pieced together out
of a pool of IP blocks for example), then the IP block's version *is*
the SoC version. In my list of "sources" of compatible values above,
it's possible that the values for multiple of those bullet points end up
being the same.

Which HW though?

Presumably eMMC/SD-card capabilities are reported by the card through
the various ID commands.

HW/driver capabilities would be reported by the driver itself. I still
don't buy the argument that no driver support is required, since
historically the different speed modes on MMC have required different
clock rates to the HW, different clock divider rounding/selection
schemes, different bug workarounds, etc.

Board capabilities (i.e. was the board routed with the right trace
impedance/... to support the UHS features, rather than something slower
because the designer didn't care about the UHS features and they're more
expensive) seem fine to go in DT.

So you would expect individual drivers to parse these (perhaps using
common code) and filter the values depending on their capabilities? If
so, why not just have the drivers set the values up themselves. Why is
there a need to represent the data in DT?
