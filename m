And very few lines later in the m25p80.c you have this:
if (data && data->type)
        id = spi_nor_match_id(data->type);

Code I touched in my patch was using both: name and type. So what you
got it "type" took a precedence and "name" value was ignored. It seems
like ppl used to use "name" to trigger "m25p80" probe, which isn't
needed (it's done by SPI layer).

Also see my comment about data->type usage I added in:
