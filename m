Hi Olof, Hi Kevin, Hi Arnd,

Please consider these third round of Renesas ARM based SoC fixes for v3.19.

This pull request is based on the previous round of
such requests, tagged as renesas-soc-fixes2-for-v3.19,
which I have already sent a pull-request for.


This fixes a regression in the r8a7790 and r8a73a4 SoCs due to
9a1091ef0017c40a ("irqchip: gic: Support hierarchy irq domain.")
which was included in v3.19-rc1.

This pull-request is targeted at v3.19. r8a7790 patch in this pull-request
conflicts with the patch "ARM: shmobile: lager: Remove legacy board
support" which was included in the pull request "Renesas ARM Based SoC
Lager Board Removal for v3.20" which you have pulled for v3.20. The
conflict occurs because board-lager.c is removed in that patch whereas
this series updates that file.

In other words, this series fixes board code for the lager/r8a7790 for v3.19
which is scheduled for removal in v3.20.
