That's great news!

I think grouping drivers together by architecture is a good
suggestion, but I personally prefer a step by step approach. So I
think we should deal with it later when we actually have more drivers
upstream.

I'm aiming for having this driver included in 2.6.27. Your driver is
targeted for some release later on, right?

Thanks!
