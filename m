Hi Simon,

Thank you for the patch.

Handling the SCSCR bits properly with DT has been on my to-do list for some 
time. Thank you for volunteering to implement that :-D

The CKE bits control both the behaviour of the SCK pin and the SCIF input 
clock selection. The SCIF can use various internal and external clocks, with 
up to two baud rate generators (programmable dividers) chained. Whether the 
SoC is provided with an external clock for its serial ports is a board 
property, not an SoC property. I would thus like to implement support for this 
feature properly and avoid hardcoding the CKE bits like done below.

The Marzen board has an external clock generator connected to the SCIF_SCK pin 
that can be used as a clock source, but I don't really see a reason why we 
couldn't use the internal P clock instead. I don't want to delay integration 
of SCIF DT support until we have a proper solution to handle clock 
configuration, but couldn't we use the internal P clock on the Marzen board in 
the meantime ?
