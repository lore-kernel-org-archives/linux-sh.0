Thanks for testing.

This doesn't sound like being related to pinctrl at all.
Devices in the PL are just memory mapped on the AXI bus. There is
nothing needed to access those. Hangs do in most cases indicate that the
IP does not respond (properly). In my experience this is mostly caused
by 
 - level shifters not enabled
 - IP kept in reset
 - IP is clock gated
With the clock gating being the culprit in most cases. Did you check
those things?
