Ok, great.

I just let you know that there is a conflict between the current Linus'
tree (with recently updated at91 fixes) and this rmk/for-armsoc branch.

I can give you the resolution of this conflict easily but I would like
to know which way I execute the merge:

I use this rmk/for-armsoc as a baseline and merge the fixes already in
Linus' tree on top of it or the other way around?

Maybe it is preferable that I wait for 3.3-rc2 and merge rmk/for-armsoc
on top of it. This result can be the base of our AT91 work for 3.4
preparation.

Your thought?

Best regards,
