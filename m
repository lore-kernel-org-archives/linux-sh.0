Hi,

Here are 9 patches for the SH Mobile LCDC and MERAM drivers. Patches 1/9 to
4/9 and 9/9 have previously been posted as part of the "SH Mobile LCDC
MERAM-based frame buffer backing store" RFC series. Patch 5/9 has also been
posted as part of the same series, albeit included in patch 9/9.

As most of those patches have already been posted for review (patches 6/9 to
8/9 that haven't been posted already are small fixes), I plan to send a pull
request soon, to get the patches in v3.6 if possible.

Laurent Pinchart (9):
  sh_mobile_meram: Rename operations to cache_[alloc|free|update]
  sh_mobile_meram: Use direct function calls for the public API
  sh_mobile_meram: Add direct MERAM allocation API
  fbdev: sh_mobile_lcdc: Destroy mutex at remove time
  fbdev: sh_mobile_lcdc: Fix line pitch computation
  fbdev: sh_mobile_lcdc: Use channel configuration to initialize fb
    device
  fbdev: sh_mobile_lcdc: Support horizontal panning
  fbdev: sh_mobile_lcdc: Fix overlay registers update during pan
    operation
  fbdev: sh_mobile_lcdc: Fix pan offset computation in YUV mode
