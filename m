Hi,

I wanted to add this information that is related to my patch
submissions. Next to the i2c timeout issues dealt in "[PATCH] i2c:
sh_mobile: Don't start transfers when suspending" I'm experiencing
another problem when using the touchscreen during the suspend process.

When handling the touch the generic_irq_handler masks out the line,
but before the irq_thread can reenable it suspension seems to finish.
Thus we get stuck in the sleep mode without being able to wake using
this device. I'm unsure if this a general fault in the suspend code or
if it is somehow driver related.

My debug output on a kzm9g looks like this:


PM: Syncing filesystems ... enabling 568
done.
PM: Preparing system for mem sleep
disabling IRQ: 568 568
enabling 568
Freezing user space processes ... disabling IRQ: 568 568

(elapsed 0.02 seconds) done.

Cheers,
