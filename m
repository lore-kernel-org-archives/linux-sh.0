Hi Simon, 
cc Ulrich,

Thanks for your patch.

I think it's a bit early to enable r8a7794
in shmobile_defconfig.

The accepted part of r8a7794 initial code lacked of
arch. timer initialization code for Cortex-A7 in r8a7794 SoC.
[PATCH 1/3] ARM: shmobile: rcar-gen2: Add CA7 arch_timer initialization for r8a7794
http://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-sh/msg34978.html

I guess (at least) that code should be merged (in current form or another)
before r8a7794 can be enabled in shmobile_defconfig.

IMO, the support is only enabled after the code under that config
run correctly.
Please correct me if I'm wrong.
