So there will be tearing on Migo-R regardless how smart our software is...

... but it should be possible to test on Migo-R even though the vsync
pin is missing.

Usually people who submit patches do the testing to make sure other
platforms won't break. I realize that it may be difficult for you if
you don't have any platform to test on.

I may be able to find a Migo-R board somewhere, and I'd be happy to
add this to my TODO list. Beware that my list is pretty long, so if
you're in a rush then I suggest you to test yourself or find someone
else to do it for you.

Cheers,
