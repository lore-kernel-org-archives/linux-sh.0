Well, there's a problem lurking here - lets take the PL011 driver.  You
convert the console write calls to use clk_enable_atomic(), leaving the
rest.

The driver will appear to work fine with a sleeping clk, until you get
a console write.  Maybe your SoC developer never tried the console on
the particular port you just tried to use?  Maybe such a driver should
use the _atomic() versions throughout?

Another solution occurs to me: clk_enable() which returns -EAGAIN if
it's called in an atomic context but needs to sleep, and let the driver
deal with the clock not being enabled when it wants it.  The down side
is it requires the driver to have additional code to sort out such a
problem.

Maybe another approach for the time being is to unify in two steps: first
unify the implementations which use a spinlock - and those which can use
a spinlock, and separately those which must use a mutex.

Then this issue can be revisited in the future.
