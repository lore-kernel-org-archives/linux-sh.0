I tried converting the renesas,irqc driver to IRQCHIP_DECLARE().
This solves the probe ordering problem, but it no longer allows the use of
a platform device. As I was already adding clock and runtime PM support
(which use platform devices), IRQCHIP_DECLARE doesn't look like the
right road to follow...
