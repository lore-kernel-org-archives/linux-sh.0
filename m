Samuel has already acked the MFD patch:

http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.ports.sh.devel/7985

(please, add this his ack to the patch too). Most of the patches in the 
series are SuperH- or SH-Mobile specific, which makes Paul (added to CC) 
the perfect candidate to review them. There is only one tmio-specific 
patch, and it is also the most complicated one. You or Paul can certainly 
just follow it to verify, that it doesn't introduce any regressions. I can 
also confirm it, because I also tested the patched driver without DMA 
loaded, and it worked just like before in PIO mode. It would, however, be 
great to test the patches on a non-sdhi hardware, of which none of us, 
probably, has any. I added Philipp Zabel to CC, who has contributed a few 
patches to tmio_mmc in the past, perhaps, he still has access to the 
hardware and could test these patches.

Thanks
Guennadi
