But does MTD_SPI_NOR (and drivers/mtd/spi-nor/) qualify as a "library"
or as a "subsystem"? I thought the latter were typically expected to be
user-selectable options, not automatically-"select"ed.

I would say that, except for its age, MTD_SPI_NOR is very similar in to
MTD_NAND (driver/mtd/nand/), which I'd consider a kind of subsystem, and
which users must select before they are asked about drivers which fall
under its category.

Perhaps my usage of the word "library" in the description was a mistake,
as I don't exactly consider it like a library in the sense of many other
"select"ed libraries.
