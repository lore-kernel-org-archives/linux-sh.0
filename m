What's the status of this ? The gpio regulator driver now defaults to voltage 
regulator when the regulator-type property is not set. Should the DT bindings 
document the property as optional (I can submit a patch for that), or do you 
consider that the gpio regulator driver should support voltage regulators only 
when used with DT, and just keep the regulator-type property support in the 
driver for backward compatibility ?
