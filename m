Except for the different naming scheme vs the code this matches my
assumptions.

In the code we have three cases (and a fourth EISA case mention in
comments, but not actually implemented as far as I can tell):

arch/parisc/kernel/pci-dma.c says in the top of file comments:

** AFAIK, all PA7100LC and PA7300LC platforms can use this code.

and the handles two different case.  for cpu_type = pcxl or pcxl2
it maps the memory as uncached for dma_alloc_coherent, and for all
other cpu types it fails the coherent allocations.

In addition to that there are the ccio and sba iommu drivers, of which
according to your above comment one is always present for pa8xxx.

Which brings us back to this patch, which ensures that no cacheable
memory is exported to userspace by removing ->mmap from ccio and sba.
It then enabled dma_mmap_coherent for the pcxl or pcxl2 case that
allocates uncached memory, which dma_mmap_coherent does not work
because dma_alloc_coherent already failed for the !pcxl && !pcxl2
and thus there is no memory to mmap.

So if the description is too confusing please suggest a better
one, I'm a little lost between all these code names and product
names (arch/parisc/include/asm/dma-mapping.h uses yet another set).
