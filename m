The compatible strings should define what the device is compatible with. They 
should start with the most specific compability and end with the less specific 
one. In this case we definitely want to list the SoC-specific compatible 
string first, even if we don't need it, as experience with Renesas SoC shows 
that subtle differences between different versions of the same IP core can be 
discovered later. If all RSPI cores are similar enough to be supported by a 
single driver configuration, then I believe "renesas,rspi" would be a proper 
second compatible string. If the RSPI cores in the SH and RZ chips are 
incompatible then we need two different strings. The same is true for QSPI.

A quick look at the driver shows that RSPI is supported without caring whether 
the SoC is an SH or ARM, so I believe "renesas,rspi" should do. The question 
in my opinion is whether we want to use

compatible = "renesas,rspi-r7s72100", "renesas,rspi";

or

compatible = "renesas,rspi-r7s72100", "renesas,rspi-rz", "renesas,rspi";

That's right.
