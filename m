Hi Morimoto-san,

Previously I was somewhat ambivalent to this but experience has shown me
that taking shmobile patches through my tree is best. The reason is that it
reduces (eliminates?) merge conflicts. Conflicts that have to be resolved by
third parties, such as Linus. And we want to make the lives of those people
as easy as possible.

So please make sure that the patches are split up such that there are
patches for the driver and patches for shmobile.  Ideally post them in
separate series but if you prefer they can go in a single series. But
regardless please note that the driver patches are for the driver
maintainer to pick up and the shmobile patches are for me.

I hope this clarifies things for you.

Thanks
