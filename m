FYI, the following series includes my attempt to address this issue:

[PATCH 00/12] ARM: shmobile: Rework include path for SoC files
[PATCH 01/12] ARM: shmobile: Add temporary include workaround
[PATCH 02/12] ARM: shmobile: Rework include path for sh7372
[PATCH 03/12] ARM: shmobile: Rework include path for sh73a0
[PATCH 04/12] ARM: shmobile: Rework include path for EMEV2
[PATCH 05/12] ARM: shmobile: Rework include path for r8a7740
[PATCH 06/12] ARM: shmobile: Rework include path for r8a7778
[PATCH 07/12] ARM: shmobile: Rework include path for r8a7779
[PATCH 08/12] ARM: shmobile: Rework include path for r8a7790
[PATCH 09/12] ARM: shmobile: Rework include path for r8a7791
[PATCH 10/12] ARM: shmobile: Rework include path for r8a73a4
[PATCH 11/12] ARM: shmobile: Rework include path for r7s72100
[PATCH 12/12] ARM: shmobile: Rework include path for common bits

If you would like me to rework the code somehow then please let me
know. I also intend to ask a different developer to convert the actual
boards once these changes have been merged by Simon, hope this is a
good way forward for you.
