Hi Simon,

Here's some feedback on your r8a7779 DT code.

Thanks for your work on this. Two things with early/late devices on r8a7779:

1)  Same thing as sh73a0 applies here, please refrain from using early
devices with DT.
2) The i2c devices as early devices look incorrect. Can you make them
late devices?

Cheers,
