Hi,

a small patch set as suggested byt Thierry to make lokkup with the lookup table
instead of device tree bahve more like when using device tree.

The first patch adds a period annd a polarity member to the lookup table and use
those to set period and polarity.

The second patch changes PWM_LOOKUP to set period an polarity. I was wondering
about adding a new macro to d that but the number of boards using it is limited
(only 3) so I guess it is ok to do that now.

The final goal would be to get rid of .pwm_period_ns in leds-pwm and pwm_bl.

Alexandre Belloni (2):
  pwm: add period and polarity to struct pwm_lookup
  pwm: use PWM_LOOKUP to set the period and polarity
