Thanks, I will see about queuing up these changes for v3.10.


I believe that with these changes it should be possible to rebase/rework
armadillo800eva-reference so that it no longer uses the unmerged INTC
DT bindings. Would it be possible for you to see about making a fresh
version of armadillo800eva-reference that is based on the next branch
in the Renesas tree plus this series of two patches?
