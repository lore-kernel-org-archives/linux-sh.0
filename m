This shows that we really want an abstraction for soc-specific SMP ops
even within one platform, and we'll need the same thing for multiplatform.

Marc Zyngier already proposed a solution for this last year, but I
think we couldn't agree on the details back then before he lost interest.
I think we should pick that up again and get it into 3.6 so the code above
can be simplified and we can do the multiplatform solution. We'll probably
discuss the details in Hong Kong in a couple of weeks, so there is no
point in changing it now, but I'd hope that you can migrate this to
whatever we come up with in the following merge window.

I would keep this together with the other SMU handling code and export a
function to set it, rather than hardcoding the address.

This looks strange: why is tmp a file-level static variable rather than
local to the modify_scu_cpu_psr function? Why do you do the writel
without the spinlock held?
