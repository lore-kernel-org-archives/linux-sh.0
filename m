Overall, I think this looks pretty reasonable, so:

Just a couple comments:

Why 1? If there's only 1 clock output from this provider, I don't see a
need for any cells, unless there are some configuration flags?

Did we decide "immutable" was actually needed? Presumably the driver for
the HW in question knows the HW isn't configurable, and would simply not
attempt to apply any configuration even if the .dts author erroneously
provided some?

So presumably that could just be "clocks = <&mclk>;"?
