This suggestion looked promising till I realized that clk_set_rate() 
will still be atomic. clk_set_rate() will need to enable/disable the 
PLLs depending on which PLLs the rates are derived from. So, the locking 
in clk_prepare/unprepare() still has to be atomic since the "slow stuff" 
is shared with clk_set_rate().

IMO, the most workable/flexible suggestion I have seen so far is:
- Having a way to explicitly ask for an atomic clock from clk_get(). 
That way the driver can decide to fail early during probe or decide to 
enable/disable in open/close or if it gets atomic clocks to 
enable/disable in atomic context.
- Atomic and sleep-able variants of clk_enable/disable/set_rate. I 
personally prefer the existing APIs to be sleep-able and introduce new 
atomic variants, but it's not worth the time arguing over that.

Taking one step at a time, do we all at least agree having two variants 
of enable/disable/set_rate?

Thanks,
Saravana
