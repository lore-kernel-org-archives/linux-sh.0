Hmm, this device node is not actually compliant to the PCI binding,
it needs a "ranges" property that can be used to look up the memory
and I/O space windows. It also needs a device_type property.

I realize that the driver doesn't currently use them, but you should
adhere to the binding anyway, so we can fix the driver at some point.
