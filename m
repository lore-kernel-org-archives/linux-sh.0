It won't be SoC v5 MMC then. It will be just MMC vX. SoC v6 will still
have MMC vX, but SoC v7 already MMC vY (where, most likely, Y=X+1). I
appreciate the fact that the SoC datasheets don't always explicitly
mention the IP revision, but it's still there. Also, quite often the
differences don't lie in the IP itself (it costs a lot of money to
license a new version of eg. MMC host controller from Synopsys), but in
the glue logic/adaptation layer etc. But in such case it probably should
be described in the tree itself. Which gets us to square one :-)

PS. Of course MMC vY may be just a superset of vX, so then it will be
compatible with "MMC vY", "MMC vX".
