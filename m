I'm not saying that it should, I just thought that it did that already,
but I may be wrong with that. Where does the polarity of a gpio
line normally get set?

It's used in the sdhci_check_ro() function, independent of whether
the bit comes from the GPIO or from the SDHCI_PRESENT_STATE
register.

It gets set based on the presence of the wp-inverted or the
older sdhci,wp-inverted property, which both get interpreted
in the same way.

Yes, it's silly and I don't see a reason why you'd do that, but I think
it should still be considered valid.

Yes, that makes sense. The way that the specific esdhc binding is written
does not refer to gpio and could be interpreted the way that it is used
in the driver (for both gpio and internal wp), but it's certainly a
good idea to clarify it in the common binding.
