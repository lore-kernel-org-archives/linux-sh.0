Subject: [PATCH] ARM: shmobile: r8a73a4: Move pfc node to work around probe ordering bug

Currently the pin function controller (which is also a GPIO controller)
is instantiated before the interrupt controllers due to the order in the
DTS. At that time, the irq domains for the interrupt controllers
referenced by its interrupts-extended property cannot be found yet:

    irq: no irq domain found for /interrupt-controller@e61c0000 !

Nevertheless, the core OF probing code ignores this failure, besides a
debug message that's not normally printed:

    not all legacy IRQ resources mapped for pfc

and continues initialization of the device. Then, the sh-pfc driver
cannot find any IRQ resources, and thinks no interrupts are available,
causing gpio-keys to fail later:

    gpio-keys keyboard: Unable to claim irq 0; error -22
    gpio-keys: probe of keyboard failed with error -22

Move the pin function controller node after the interrupt controller
nodes it references to work around the bug in the core OF probing code.

Notes:
  - It seems several people tried to solve this in the core OF probing
    code before, but the final solution never went in?
  - This can be reproduced on other SoCs (e.g. sh73a0 and r8a7740) by
    moving their pfc nodes before their interrupt controller nodes.
  - This patch is against my working tree, so it doesn't apply to
    Simon's repository, but you get the idea....
