They are also my thoughts (except the bit about deferring to myself).

If there is a good motivation for a Renesas prefix then that is fine by me.
But in that case it seems that it would be appropriate to update
the existing renesas boards too.

The only thing that stood out to me about "SILK" was that unlike
other renesas boards names in .dtsi files it is all-capitals.
Its not a bit deal but as we are on the topic: is that intentional?
