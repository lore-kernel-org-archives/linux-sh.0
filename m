Hi,

these patches add sound support to the r8a7795/Salvator-X.

These patches are an update of work by Kuninori Morimoto,
broken out of a larger patchset posted by him.

The main change to the patches themselves since Morimoto-san's v3 posting
and v4 updates to that posting is to update to new CPG/MSSR bindings via
Geert Uytterhoeven.

Morimoto-san, I would be most grateful if you could look over this and repost
if there are problems.

Base:

* "[PATCH v4 0/3] arm64: renesas: r8a7795: add I2C support"
  This can be found in the topic/r8a7795-i2c-v4 branch of
  my renesas tree on kernel.org.

Availability:
* This patchset is available in the  topic/r8a7795-sound-v5 branch of my
  renesas tree on kernel.org
