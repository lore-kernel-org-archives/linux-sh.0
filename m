Hello.

   Here's the set of 4 patches against the Simon Horman's 'renesas.git' repo,
'renesas-next-20130416' tag and the R8A7779/Marzen patchset I've posted.
 It was created to add support of R8A7778/BOCK-W USB to the platform code and
the USB common PHY driver, and so spans both arch/arm/mach-shmobile/ and
drivers/usb/phy/ subtrees.

[1/4] rcar-phy: add R8A7778 support
[2/4] ARM: shmobile: r8a7778: add USB support
[3/4] ARM: shmobile: BOCK-W: add USB support
[4/4] ARM: shmobile: BOCK-W: enable USB in defconfig

WBR, Sergei
