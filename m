Subject: [PATCH 7/9] ARM: shmobile: r8a7790: Correct SYS DMAC clock defines
Message-Id: <b998da0541e64da5bd857c09347c0fa954c03432.1393401266.git.horms+renesas@verge.net.au>

This brings the implementation into line with the documentation.

This problem was introduced when SYS DMAC clock defines were added by
ac991dce6498b5fc ("ARM: shmobile: r8a7790: Add clock index macros for DT
sources") in v3.13-rc2. I do not believe this results in any problems as
these defines do not appear to be used anywhere yet.
