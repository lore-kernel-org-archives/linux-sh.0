I generally like __maybe_unused, but it's a matter of personal preference.
We could avoid the __maybe_unused if the reg_slave/unreg_slave callback
pointers are always available in struct i2c_algorithm.

Just for reference, see below for my combined patch, in case you decide
to use that at a later point.

Subject: [PATCH] i2c: emev2 depends on i2c slave mode

The emev2 driver stopped compiling in today's linux-next kernel:

drivers/i2c/busses/i2c-emev2.c: In function 'em_i2c_slave_irq':
drivers/i2c/busses/i2c-emev2.c:233:23: error: storage size of 'event' isn't known
drivers/i2c/busses/i2c-emev2.c:250:3: error: implicit declaration of function 'i2c_slave_event' [-Werror=implicit-function-declaration]
drivers/i2c/busses/i2c-emev2.c:250:32: error: 'I2C_SLAVE_STOP' undeclared (first use in this function)

It works again if we enable CONFIG_I2C_SLAVE, but it seems  wrong
to add a dependency on that symbol:

* The symbol is user-selectable, but only one or two (including this
  one) bus drivers actually implement it, and it makes no sense
  if you don't have one of them.

* The other driver (R-Car) uses 'select I2C_SLAVE', which seems
  reasonable in principle, but we should not do that on user
  visible symbols.

* I2C slave mode could be implemented in a lot of other drivers
  as an optional feature, but we shouldn't require enabling it
  if we don't use it.

This changes the two drivers that provide I2C slave mode so they
can again build if the slave mode being disabled. To do this, I
move the definition of i2c_slave_event() and enum i2c_slave_event
out of the #ifdef and instead make the assignment of the reg_slave
and unreg_slave pointers optional in the bus drivers. The functions
implementing the feature are unused in that case, so they get
marked as __maybe_unused in order to still give compile-time
coverage.
