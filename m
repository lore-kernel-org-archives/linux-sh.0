Hey,

I know I'm probably not the worlds promptest or easiest maintainer to
work with, but I'd just like to say a quick thanks to everyone
involved with the tmio-mmc driver. You've all put in a lot of effort
to make it what it is today.

Its really nice to see it being used in such a huge array of devices -
something which was my goal since the very beginning when I helped
author the MFD core. Back then ASIC3 was the only similar device I
knew of, and tmio-mmc owes some thanks to the early ASIC3 work as well
as a couple of people in Toshiba who were willing to stick their necks
out enough to get me what little documentation (register specs and
little more) that they could.

Cheers guys!
