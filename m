And that's the common case.  Most architectures use a single page for at
least one level of the pte/pmd/pud/p4d/pgd hierarchy.  Some use multiple
pages and some use a fraction of a page.

Those can be added later.  Note I said "one or two", and that's what I
had in mind; I think we want one function that allocates just a page
and another that allocates a page fragment.  Then we can have a good
discussion about what method we use; s390 and ppc use different techniques
today and there's really no good reason for that.
