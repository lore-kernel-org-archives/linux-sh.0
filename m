Sure. This doesn't have to be a flag day. Architectures can move over if and
when they're ready. I haven't looked very closely at any other architectures
but I'm sure some of them could make use of this series.

Eek! I totally messed this up, sorry. Thanks very much for compiling
these and reviewing them. I've just grabbed an ARM toolchain so I'll
compile the next version before I post it ;-)

You've highlighted a good point - the allocation and freeing is done in
the wrong places. We need a function in drivers/oprofile/oprofile_perf.c
that is called from oprofile_arch_init() that allocates the
'counter_config' and 'perf_events[]' data structures. These can then be
freed by a similiar function in oprofile_arch_exit().

Ah, I see what you mean. I'll fold this change into my series to avoid
conflicts, but as a separate patch. I'll retain your authorship in the
commit just be sure to check it when I send out V2 of this series to
make sure I haven't messed your patch up.

Thanks for the review!
