DEBUG_LL=y may help you here. It's easier than doing a post-mortem analysis
on __log_buf from U-Boot.
As we still have anti-social platforms, you best remove all non-SCIF default
addresses from the DEBUG_UART_PHYS section in arch/arm/Kconfig.debug though.

3.14 has (limited) RZ/A1H multi-platform support. Perhaps you can try getting
XIP to work with a multi-platform v3.14 kernel first, and find out what broke
in newer versions later?
