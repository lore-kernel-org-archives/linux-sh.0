I don't really see why you want to have "no IO at all" in the
tmio/sdhi specific files.

Actually, I think it makes sense to abstract based on the hardware
register layout difference.

 Since some parts of the code only applies to tmio (offset >=3D 0x100)
and some only to SDHI (TMIO_MMC_SDIO_IRQ), why don't you do the
following:

In tmio_mmc_pio.c:

tmio_mmc_core_clk_start()
tmio_mmc_core_clk_stop()
tmio_mmc_core_reset()

Above functions only implement offset < 0x100 and no TMIO_MMC_ stuff
in there if possible

In tmio_mmc.c

tmio_mmc_clk_start()
tmio_mmc_clk_stop()
tmio_mmc_reset()

Above 3 functions call tmio_mmc_core_xxx() and also implement >=3D 0x100
offset access.

In sh_mobile_sdhi.c

sh_mobile_sdhi_clk_start()
sh_mobile_sdhi_clk_stop()
sh_mobile_sdhi_reset()

Above 3 functions call tmio_mmc_core_xxx() and perhaps also implement SDIO =
IRQ.

Ideally we want to share the SDIO IRQ code with the TMIO MFD
implementation, but we're not really receiving any test feedback from
anyone, so from my POV to avoid breakage we may as well keep things in
the SDHI portion and move over to the common place if needed in the
future.
