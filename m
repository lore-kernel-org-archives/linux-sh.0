Well, or at least you have to add the auxdata table entries as you enable
drivers, it doesn't have to be strictly coordinated.

Anyway, that isn't really worth arguing here since it's not relevant to
the shmobile case. If doing clocks this way makes more sense for you
for now, you should continue with it. Sounds like people are aware of
the trade-offs, etc.

Yep, agreed. Thanks for the update on your plans as well, Magnus.
