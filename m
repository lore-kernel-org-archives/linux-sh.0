No no.  Any reason will be good to do the same for other stuff and we 
really don't want to go back there.  If anything it is the needed 
defines that need to move closer to the driver code not the other way 
around.

And by the time the EOL'd boards are really getting into the way of 
cleanups we could do one of two things: simply leave them alone and 
prevent them from participating into a multi-SOC kernel config. Or add a 
#error "Do you care about me?" in them (and remove them from any 
defconfig) and see if anyone notices.  If not then we just delete them.
