Thanks for testing. In case of EMEV2 we don't have any PFC support, so
because of that you probably need to deselect PINCTRL. The patch below
does the trick, but for proper operation you probably have to split
this up per-SoC. And these days KZM9D is MULTIPLATFORM only where
PINCTRL probably wants to be set as a global default, so I suppose the
proper way to support this is to add PFC support for EMEV2.

Another option would be to make these two cases behave the same:
- PINCTRL=y but no pinctrl support for the SoC
- PINCTRL=n
