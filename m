Please allow me a semantic correction here: this commit never broke 
anything. It merely revealed how platform code (OMAP, iMX6, shmobile) 
abused the irq_domain subsystem, hoping to get away with only a partial 
conversion to DT. The platform code itself was broken from the moment it 
used DT to discover its interrupt controller.

The truth is, it is not possible to sanely convert bits of a platform 
to DT. The changes creep into all the subsystems, and doing it in stages 
requires tons of ugly hacks (and I've written my share of them).

That being said, I'm off reviewing these two matches.

Thanks,

         M.
