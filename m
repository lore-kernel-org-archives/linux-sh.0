In the course of testing this patch I created
a patch to update the defconfig. I will post it with
a patch to use DT for SMP but I have some questions about this patch.

It seems to me that the following is also needed:

* Select USE_OF in Kconfig
* Provide dt_compat in DT_MACHINE_START
* Provide r8a7779-marzen dts

I have a revised version of this patch which does the above.
But I wanted to check with you that I am on the right track
before posting it.


Also, I think that once sh73a0 and r8a7779 uses DT for SMP we can remove
shmobile_smp_init_cpus(). As you have posted a patch for sh73a0 I have
prepated a patch for r8a7779 I have also prepared a patch to remove
shmobile_smp_init_cpus().

My plan is to post all relevant patches as a series once
my questions above are resolved.
