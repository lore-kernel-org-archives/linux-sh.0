Works for me, but wouldn't that mean that half the shmobile boards
become incompatible with the other half, forcing you to build two
separate kernels if you want to run on all the machines?

Maybe that's not a problem for you, since you tend to have per-soc
defconfigs  anyway, and it will only be temporary.

Correct.

Yes. I believe all distros are planning to build one non-LPAE nd one
LPAE kernel. There will have to be a way to enable all LPAE-capable
platforms in Kconfig, but I don't know if that exists already.

Presumably, the LPAE kernel will also be using THUMB2 in the kernel,
while the non-LPAE kernel may get built with ARMv6 platform support
enabled, which rules out THUMB2.

Also, we could enable KVM support in the non-LPAE kernel, but since 
all KVM capable CPU cores (Cortex-A7 and Cortex-A15) so far also
come with LPAE, that's not even necessary.

You can always use #address-cells=<2> in the DT root node if that
helps, and you can also keep your peripherals using #address-cells=<1>
with an appropriate ranges property in the soc bus node.
