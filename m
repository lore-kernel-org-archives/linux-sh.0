I think, Rafael is the best person to explain, why exactly this is not 
desired. In short, this is the wrong location to make such decisions and 
to define these criteria. The only thing, that the driver may be aware of 
is how quickly it wants to be able to wake up, if it got suspended. And 
it's already the PM subsystem, that has to decide, whether it can satisfy 
this requirement or not. Rafael will correct me, if my explanation is 
wrong.

I think it is a reason not to execute them during an intensive IO, yes. I 
cannot imagine a case, where if you have multiple IO requests waiting in 
the queue to your medium, you would want to switch off and immediately on 
again. Well, of course, such situations might exist, but then you just 
have to define and use a different governor on your system. This is also 
the flexibility, that this API is giving you.
