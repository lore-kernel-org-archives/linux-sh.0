Me neither!  However, reverting the commit isn't the answer.

ARM shmobile platforms are ARM architecture V6 or V7, both of which have
the architectural restriction that multiple mappings of the same physical
address space must have the same memory type and cache attributes.  We
know that some ARMv7 systems do bad things when multiple different
mappings exist - and as they're using ARM's own Cortex CPU designs, and
I doubt shmobile is any different in that...

So, basically going forward with the advent of VIPT caches on ARM, any
kernel interface which allows system RAM to be remapped with different
attributes from the lowmem mapping is bad news - that means (eg) using
vmap() with a non-PGPROT_KERNEL pgprot has become illegal.  Certainly
using ioremap() on mapped system RAM on VIPT has become illegal, and
that's what has now been prevented.

It's actually a restriction which x86 gained some time ago, which I
stupidly continued to permit on ARM.  Now that our hardware has gained
the same restriction, we're now going to be into the same learning
curve...

I haven't worked out how sh_mobile_ceu gets used on the ARM shmobile
platforms - afaics, nothing in arch/arm/mach-shmobile declares a
sh_mobile_ceu platform device.

(When sparsemem's inability to deal with... sparse memory gets fixed
and we have a pfn_valid() which says it does what it says on the tin,
ioremap() might be able to be used with memory which hasn't been
declared to the kernel - as is currently the case with flatmem.)
