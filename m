Yes.

The flexibility would still be there with individual CONFIG_PINCTRL...
but IIUC, what you want is to be able to easily select only
ARCH_R8A7795. If you start from defconfig, there are a lot more things
to disable already, so I don't see how ARCH_R8A7795 helps here. Unless
you start from allnoconfig and build up your configuration which,
again, requires considerable more work (not something I would call
easy).

We either keep it or remove it altogether, I don't see much point in a
dependency on EXPERT.

It's not about allowing "expert" users to select certain features but
whether we want to continue the model of individual SoC support in arm64
vs. SoC _family_ with a possibility to trim down unwanted drivers
(including pinctrl, clocks) which are not needed for a SoC-specific
kernel.

Anyway, I'll leave the decision to the arm-soc folk.
