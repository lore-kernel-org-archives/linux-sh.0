Hopefully, Geert's patch will be applied to avoid build errors in both the
rcar-pcie and rcar-pci-gen2 (internal USB bridge) drivers. Meanwhile I'll fix
the rcar-pcie driver properly for arm64.

I was told that rcar pcie on v4.3-rc5 had an issue with MSI. I've since checked
That both v4.3-rc7 and next work ok out of the box on the Koelsch board.
There are some problems with next (mstp related), but it doesn't stop the
board booting and being able to test pcie. Since shmobile arm64 is not in
next yet, I have not checked this.

Sure, though what tree? As I mentioned above, next doesn't have
shmobile arm64 yet.

Thanks
