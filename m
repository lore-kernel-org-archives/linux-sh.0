Hi Geert,

I would like Magnus's opinion but mine is that the non-WIP patches
could be queued up. At least patch 1 and 2. Possibly others if
they don't depend (other than diff noise) on WIP patches.

With the WIP patches, I am not entirely opposed to merging them
too, so long as they move things in a good direction. And in particular
don't break anything.
