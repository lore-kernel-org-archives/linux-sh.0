Ok, thanks for checking this. It seems that we are "lucky" to find
this breakage...

In the future, please take care to make sure this does not happen
again. This goes without saying, but the driver should not access the
hardware when it is Runtime PM suspended. I believe it should be
possible to verify the code paths by manual code inspection. Also, to
make the behavior more consistent you may want to make use of
"pm_runtime_put_sync()" instead of "pm_runtime_put()".

Thanks,
