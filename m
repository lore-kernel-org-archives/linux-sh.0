Hi Laurent,

I have a few comments.

Minor nit, but would be nice to have "Should contain one of the
following:". We might have future variants whereby the compatible string
will actually be a string list.

Is the "-generic" suffix necessary? Why not just "renesas,scif" etc?

Presumably the SoC-specific version should come first; it would be nice
to note that.

I assume by memory resource you mean the memory-mapped registers?
Resource sounds like Linux-internal nomenclature leaking.

I don't think this is strictly necessary. It's implicit by default and
can be added optionally when a system is wired in a complex way. As it's
a completely standard optional property I'm not even sure it needs to be
documented.

Minor nit: "Should contain an interrupt-specifier for ..."

I saw the cover mentioned multiple interrupts. Which logical interrupt
output of the device are you expecting here?

Minor nit: s/Reference to/A phandle + clock-specifier pair for/

As we're using clock-names, it would be nicer still to define clocks in
terms of clock-names so as to make it easier to update the document in
future and make the expected use of clock-names clearer:

- clocks: Should contain a phandle + clock-specifier pair for each entry
  in clock-names.

- clock-names: Should contain "sci_ick".

Otherwise this looks good to me.

Thanks,
Mark.
