The code is more or less doing the same thing as the ads7846 driver,
except this one is communicating over i2c instead of spi. This means
is because of great hardware design with interrupts that needs to be
acked over an extremely slow serial bus. So we just disable the
interrupt and handle everything from a different context. Apart from
avoiding serious latency issues, doing things from interrupt context
simply won't work since the i2c bus driver may be interrupt driven and
may sleep while waiting for the serial bus data to be sent.

And you are right, this won't work with shared interrupts.

Yeah, having a comment in there would certainly help.

No can do, the serial bus is too slow.

Good catch. I'll fix this up and repost.

Thanks!
