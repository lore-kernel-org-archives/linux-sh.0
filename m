Good idea, that would indeed simpify the logic, both in Kconfig and
renesas-scif.S.

I gave it a try. On Armadillo it worked, on kzm9g it didn't.
Probably the virtual address choice is wrong.

As I can't test it on the other boards using map_io(), I'd like to
keep this as-is
for now. We can migrate them gradually later.
