No, I meant v3.2. As I haven't received any pull notification in response to 
the patch, and as I had no way to check your fbdev-next tree on kernel.org, I 
just wanted to make sure the patch would be queued for v3.2.

Please ignore this e-mail (and the other similar ones I've just sent) if the 
patches are already in your queue. And thank you for picking them.
