If clk->ops->prepare is NULL, then clk_prepare() better return success
as it should mean "no preparation necessary", not "someone didn't
implement it so its an error".

Calling clk->ops->enable() with a spinlock held will ensure that no one
tries to make that method sleep, so if people want sleeping stuff they
have to use the clk_prepare() stuff.  It's a self-enforcing API which
ensures that we don't get sleeping stuff inside clk_enable().

And with a check in clk_enable() for a preparation, it helps to ensure
that drivers do call clk_prepare() before clk_enable() - though it can't
guarantee it in every case.
