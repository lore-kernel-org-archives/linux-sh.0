This is a hack actually. The problem lies with the gpio backlight
driver - it should really set the mode to output, not leave it as is.
If there's no good reason to keep it as it is now, I'll add another
patch to the series that moves the call to devm_gpiod_get() to where
we've already determined the initial value in probe() and pass an
appropriate GPIOD_OUT_HIGH/LOW flag.
