Thanks.

It seems to me that we have some consensus around:

	compatible = "renesas,r1ex24002", "24c02";

Should this be added to Documentation/devicetree/bindings/eeprom/eeprom.txt ?
Or documented elsewhere?

I believe that as well as any documentation and update of this patch-set
that r8a7791-koelsch.dts will also need to be updated. I plan to do so.
