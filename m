Thanks for leading the way! From my side I don't have any special
feeling, so why don't you and Simon decide?

If it was up to me only then I think option #1 that simply reduces the
feature set seems rather natural, but perhaps it requires a lot of
rework of the patches. If we go with option #1 we can always
incrementally add D4 and A4MP later I assume.
