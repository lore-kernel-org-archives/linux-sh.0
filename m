echo mem > /sys/power/state on Armadillo 800 EVA was my test case. It failed 
without the patch, and succeeds with it.

Yes it still works. However, I have no way to test the MMC_SLEEP_AWAKE command 
on the Mackerel board, as my MMC card doesn't support it (on the Armadillo the 
eMMC chip supports the MMC_SLEEP_AWAKE command).

BTW, I wonder whether the current implementation is really the best one. If 
the hardware doesn't support SD/SDIO commands, instead of intercepting 
commands and rejecting the ones used by SD/SDIO at probe time, wouldn't it be 
better for host drivers to tell that they don't support SD and/or SDIO using 
flags in the mmc_host structure ?
