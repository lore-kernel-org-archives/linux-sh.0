From my point of view,
I have no object to adding SoC-specific compatible
string on dts(i) file.
It can be insurance for future (above 1, 2, 3).

My concern is to add "known working SoC" to documentation.
I have no objection if this listed "known working SoC" 
was matched to "SoC-specific" compatible name.
Because driver cares it specially.
And, this case, documentation should list it.

But this case, listed SoC are matched to "generic name".

From my (general?) point of view,
it seems that these listed SoC doesn't match to "generic name".
I mean that driver will do something special for these SoC.
And, we will confuse if driver supports "SoC-specific" compatible name.
(which one is special ? which one is generic ?)

And, I don't want to keep updating
"generic name matched SoC" on document.
