Or you can set it in firmware/boot-loader before Linux starts.

I don't think this is true. See this thread:

IMO, this should always be done, independent of any DT or kernel
configuration. I stated it several times already that I don't see why we
would ever need such bit cleared:

http://lists.infradead.org/pipermail/linux-arm-kernel/2015-March/330573.html

Personally I don't think this configuration belongs to the DT,
especially as it may depend on how the OS is configured. But since
Russell has refused to take patches setting this bit by default (I have
yet to see a valid argument), it's still better than nothing.
