This patch series integrates Renesas RSPI on the RZ/A1H aka R7S72100 SoC,
and the Genmai development board.

The series is based on renesas-devel-v3.13-rc7-20140109v2, with Magnus'
pinctrl, Wolfram's riic, and Simon's sh_eth work applied on top.
[Simon: I don't know in which order you will merge these. If you want me
 to rebase my patches, just ask! Thanks!]

It was tested on the Genmai development board (genmai-reference), using
an in-kernel version of Documentation/spi/spidev_test.c, exercising
loopback mode on rspi1, with the same outcome as the SDK reference code.

It will not yet work with the non-reference version of genmai, due to
missing pinmux configuration in setup-r7s72100.c.

    [1/5] pinctrl: sh-pfc: r7s72100: Add RSPI support
    [2/5] ARM: shmobile: r7s72100: Add RSPI clocks
    [3/5] ARM: shmobile: genmai: Add RSPI support
    [4/5] [RFC] ARM: shmobile: genmai: Add preliminary RSPI pinmux
    [5/5] ARM: shmobile: genmai: Enable RSPI in defconfig

Changes in V2:
  - Add "ARM: shmobile: genmai: Add RSPI children"
  - Add "[RFC] ARM: shmobile: genmai: Add preliminary RSPI pinmux"

Changes in V3:
  - Implement review comments
  - Add defconfig update
  - Remove DT support patches, they will be sent in a separate series
  - Merge "ARM: shmobile: r7s72100: Add RSPI platform devices" and
    "ARM: shmobile: genmai: Add RSPI children"

Thanks!
