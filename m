Certainly.

There's no choice there. The compatible property needs to specify all of
the following:

* A value which describes the exact chip the IP block is in. This can be
matched on to enable any quirks that need to be handled due to
integration of the IP into the particular chip. This value will list the
chip version. An example might be tegra20-sdhci.

* A value which describes the IP block version (if that IP block has a
version independent of the SoC that contains it, as e.g. a Synopsis IP
block might). A totally made-up example might be synopsis-dwc2-1.0.0

* Various more generic values that describe the HW, and that define a n
interface to the HW that is specific and complete enough that HW can
program to. An example might be usb-ehci (assuming a chip that doesn't
have so many quirks that a driver has to know more than just "it's an
EHCI controller).

Further classes of compatible value might exist, but you get the idea.

All of those values have to exist in the DT right from the very start,
so that the first DT is usable with a future kernel, which might decide
to vary the exact compatible value(s) it matches on, provided they're
all documented in the DT binding ABI, in order to enable/disable new
sets of quirsk.

That would be a bug in the DT, given my assertions above.

My preference would certainly be to derive the data from compatible
strings here. I'd prefer more that DT represent board differences rather
than SoC differences; drivers can encompass the SoC differences with
minimal code in general.

Related, is it really true that zero driver involvement is required to
enable these UHS features? If absolutely any HW can enable them without
any driver support at all, then perhaps it's still reasonable to create
DT properties to enable them. However, if driver support is required to
make those features actually work, the driver had better be validating
that support actually works on the HW it's running on before enabling
the feature (and can therefore pass the validation results to the SD
core rather than relying on DT properties to be set). I'm pretty sure
that our downstream Tegra SDHCI driver contains a lot of code to make
UHS actually work, even though the HW does support it, and hence with
this patch applied, the DT would request that it be enabled.
