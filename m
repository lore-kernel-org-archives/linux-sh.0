I got the DMA controller hooked up to DMAEngine and the dmatest module is happy
with the result on all 8 channels. (Finding
arch/sh/kernel/cpu/sh4a/setup-sh7722.c helped a lot, finding it earlier would
have helped more. :)

The config symbols are:

CONFIG_SH_DMA=y
CONFIG_DMADEVICES=y
CONFIG_SH_DMAE_BASE=y
CONFIG_SH_DMAE=y
CONFIG_DMATEST=y #optional

The platform data is:

#include <cpu/dma-register.h>
#include <cpu/dma.h>
#include <linux/sh_dma.h>

/* DMA */
static struct resource sh7760_dma_resources[] = {
	{
		.start  = SH_DMAC_BASE0,
		.end    = SH_DMAC_BASE0 + 9*16 - 1,
		.flags  = IORESOURCE_MEM,
	}, {
		.start  = DMTE0_IRQ,
		.end    = DMTE0_IRQ,
		.flags  = IORESOURCE_IRQ,
	}
};

	{
		.offset = 0,

		.dmars_bit = 0,
	}, {
		.offset = 0x10,
		.dmars = 0,
		.dmars_bit = 8,
	}, {
		.offset = 0x20,
		.dmars = 4,
		.dmars_bit = 0,
	}, {

		.dmars_bit = 0,
	}, {
		.offset = 0x80,
		.dmars = 12,
		.dmars_bit = 8,
	}
};

static const unsigned int ts_shift[] = TS_SHIFT;

static struct sh_dmae_pdata sh7760_dma_pdata = {
	.channel = dma_chan,
	.channel_num = ARRAY_SIZE(dma_chan),
        .ts_low_shift   = CHCR_TS_LOW_SHIFT,
        .ts_low_mask    = CHCR_TS_LOW_MASK,
        .ts_high_shift  = CHCR_TS_HIGH_SHIFT,
        .ts_high_mask   = CHCR_TS_HIGH_MASK,
        .ts_shift       = ts_shift,
        .ts_shift_num   = ARRAY_SIZE(ts_shift),
        .dmaor_init     = DMAOR_INIT,
	.dmaor_is_32bit = 1,
};

struct platform_device sh7760_dma_device = {
        .name           = "sh-dma-engine",
        .id             = -1,
        .num_resources  = ARRAY_SIZE(sh7760_dma_resources),
        .resource       = sh7760_dma_resources,
	.dev = {.platform_data = &sh7760_dma_pdata},
};


And then add sh7760_dma_device to your struct platform_device array.

The dmatest module didn't need it? I don't see why the ethernet driver would?
(Isn't the point of an allocator to allocate from a request?)

I think all 8 channels are generic. Drivers should be able to grab them and
release them at will, why does it need a table?

(I say this not having made the smc91x.c driver use this yet, its "conversion"
to device tree left it full of PXA #ifdefs and constants, and I've tried the
last half-dozen kernel releases and qemu releases and have yet to find an arm
mainstone board under qemu that _doesn't_ time out trying to use DMA with this
card. But that's another post...)

I had to switch that off to get this to work, yes. I believe it predates
dmaengine and was obsoleted by it.
