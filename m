I quoted it because it explains what was done.

IMHO the "power-domains" property naming is wrong: it should have been
"pm-domains", as it's following the spirit of the Linux PM Domain abstraction.

PM Domain = Collection of devices treated similarly w.r.t. power management

"similarly" here means "using module clocks". And yes the datasheet states
that's what the module clocks do: control supply of the clock signal to the
module.

The driver can still override if it feels the need.

The driver for the subnode device can still create child devices, can't it?
