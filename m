As I understand things, the Armadillo is currently the only
board in-tree that uses the r8a7740 SoC and it seems
reasonable to enable performance events to activate the
code that comprises the rest of the patch.

So while I don't feel strongly about this I do have a slight preference
for the current single-patch approach.

Thanks, there seems to be an extra tab there.

I'll roll this into an updated patch and series once
we come to a consensus about the defconfig change.
