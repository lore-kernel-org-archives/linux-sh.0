Subject: [PATCH/RFC v2 0/2] CPUFreq for kzm9g

In v2 of this patch-set I dropped patches 1 and 3, because #1 is a bug-fix 
and can go in separately, #3 is more of a debugging help, than a real 
patch for mainlining. Of the remaining 2 patches the main difference to v1 
is the omission of the PLL0 manipulation. More is explained in respective 
patches.

Guennadi Liakhovetski (2):
  ARM: shmobile: sh73a0: add support for adjusting CPU frequency
  ARM: shmobile: kzm9g-reference: add CPUFreq support

Thanks
Guennadi
