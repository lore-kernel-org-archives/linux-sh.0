Have you actually tried the above?

All our drivers rely on Runtime PM for the power/clock domain handling.
I believe the pm_runtime_get_sync() won't do anything if you haven't enabled
Runtime PM for the device, so the device's module clock won't be enabled at
all.

Hence I think you should add just add additional pm_runtime_get_sync()/
pm_runtime_put() calls in the driver's probe() and remove() methods if
multi-master mode is enabled.
