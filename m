Pulled into next/dt, thanks!

There is one new warning I got in the for-next branch after the last round
of pull requests, in mackerel_defconfig:

arch/arm/mach-shmobile/pm-sh7372.c:116:33: warning: 'sh7372_pm_domains' defined but not used [-Wunused-variable]
 static struct rmobile_pm_domain sh7372_pm_domains[] = {
                                 ^

I haven't looked at it in detail, can you find out what caused it and
send a fix with your next round?
