To make it clear, both print_symbol() and printk(%pS)
print the adress using sprint_symbol(). And even printk(%pS)
uses the buffer on the stack, see:

char *symbol_string(char *buf, char *end, void *ptr,
		    struct printf_spec spec, const char *fmt)
{
[...]
	char sym[KSYM_SYMBOL_LEN];
[...]
		sprint_symbol(sym, value);
}

Anyway, print_symbol() is an old weird API and it would be nice
to eventually get rid of it. I could take this patches into
printk.git. Would you mind if I change the commit messages
to something like?:

    print_symbol() is an old weird API. It has been
    obsoleted by printk() and %pS format specifier.

Best Regards,
Petr
