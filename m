	Hi Simon, Magnus, Sato-san,

This patch series renames the serial port clock to fck, cfr. "[PATCH v3
01/27] serial: sh-sci: Drop the interface clock" or series "[PATCH v3
00/27] serial: sh-sci: External Clock Support".

This series is an updated version of the DT changes of a series I sent
before as "[PATCH v2 00/16] serial: sh-sci: Clock Cleanups"
(http://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-serial/msg19762.html). To reduce
(cross) dependencies, I split off the core patches and BRG DT patches
into separate series.

Changes compared to previous submission:
  - Add Acked-by,
  - Update for "[PATCH 0/2] ARM: shmobile: r8a7793: Increase scif
    support".

Dependencies:
  - This series is against renesas-devel-20151214-v4.4-rc5, with the
    following applied on top:
      - "[PATCH 0/7] ARM: shmobile: dtsi: Add SCIF fallback
	 compatibility strings",
  - It has a hard dependency on the aforementioned "[PATCH v3 01/27]
    serial: sh-sci: Drop the interface clock", so depending on the
    merge strategy chosen, it may have to be postponed to v4.6,
  - Later series depend on this:
      - "[PATCH v2 0/7] ARM: shmobile: dtsi: Add BRG support for
	 (H)SCIF"
      - "[PATCH v2 0/9] ARM: shmobile: dts: Enable SCIF_CLK frequency
	 and pins".

Sato-san: I took the liberty to include the h8300 DTS changes in this
series. Perhaps you may want to provide your ack, so Simon can take it
together with the ARM shmobile changes?

Thanks!
