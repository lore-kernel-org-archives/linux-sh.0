Definitely not all drivers, but those that runs pm_runtime_get_sync()
during ->probe() and expects the ->runtime_resume() callback to always
be invoked because of that. I guess we need to check upon which
drivers that may suffer from this.

I wouldn't be surprised if at least a subset of those cases we find,
are poorly designed from PM point of view and won't even probe
successfully unless CONFIG_PM is set. Whatever that means...

That would be a more generic approach, although I am not sure how the
driver/PM core should be able to take the correct decision in this
phase. Devices may be runtime PM managed also without a driver bound.

Perhaps when __device_release_driver() finds a bounded driver for the
device, it could after all actions been performed to unbind the
driver, check if runtime PM is enabled. If it isn't, it could set the
runtime PM status to suspended!?

I have no idea if that would introduce other issues as it would kind
of force the runtime PM status of the device to suspend, without
actually knowing if it's the correct thing to do.

Kind regards
Uffe
