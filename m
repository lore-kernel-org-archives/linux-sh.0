No, I don't - my ack holds:) However, I do have some concerns regarding a 
couple of other possible issues with SCI DMA:

1. As I mentioned earlier, I think, sci_start_tx() should always be called 
under the port spinlock to get consistent ->cookie_tx and ->chan_tx 
values. This is the case, when called from serial core as 
->start_tx() from most locations, but not from uart_handle_cts_change(), 
which is an exported function. It is also called internally in the SCI 
driver itself several times - with no locking. This might need fixing, 
especially in sci_tx_dma_release().

2. The DMA Tx work might need to be cancelled from time to time... E.g., 
when DMA is disabled to switch to PIO, or when shutting down the port.

Both of these might require a bit more thinking and testing.

Thanks
