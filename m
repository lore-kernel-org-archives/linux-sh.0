As we now have "renesas,clock-indices" in v3.14, the question about backwards
compatibility became moot.

Can you please combine your two patches

[PATCH 1/2] clk: shmobile: clk-mstp: change to using clock-indices
[PATCH 2/2] clk: shmobile: clk-mstp: add backwards comapt for indices field

into a single patch, and submit to Mike?

Once it's in Mike's clk-next, we can do the following to get everything in
v3.15:
  1. Simon cherry-picks Mike's commit into his fixes-for-v3.15 branch,
  2. we fix arch/arm/boot/dts/r8a7790.dtsi and .../r8a7791.dtsi there,
  3. fixes-for-v3.15 gets into mainline through arm-soc.

Does that sound like plan?

Thanks!

Gr{oetje,eeting}s,

                        Geert
