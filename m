Brad trolls us all lightly with this trivia question:

https://twitter.com/grsecurity/status/905246423591084033

"For #trivia can you describe one scenario where this change actually
helps exploitation using similar C string funcs?"

I suppose the expected answer is:

The change helps exploitation when the overwriting string ends just
before the canary.  Its NUL overwriting the NUL byte in the canary would
go undetected.  Before this change, there would be a 255/256 chance of
detection.

I hope this was considered.  The change might still be a good tradeoff,
or it might not, depending on which scenarios are more likely (leak of
canary value or the string required in an exploit ending at that exact
byte location), and we probably lack such statistics.

I am not proposing to revert the change.  I had actually contemplated
speaking up when this was discussed, but did not for lack of a better
suggestion.  We could put/require a NUL in the middle of the canary, but
with the full canary being only 64-bit at most that would also make some
attacks easier.

So this is JFYI.  No action needed on it, I think.
