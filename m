This isn't the right fix.  When this has happened on ARM in the past, we've
had a lot of pressure to change the definition since it's far too generic.

"CCR" should only be used for stuff which is restricted to (eg) one driver,
and not in some system wide header file included by lots of files.

In the case of OMAP, the unfortunate thing is that include/linux/omap-dma.h
was moved lock stock and barrel out of the ARM-private includes.  It
really needs splitting up in two - one which drivers are expected to
include, and the other for shared definitions between arch/arm/*omap*/dma.c
and drivers/dma/omap-dma.c.

Even so, "CCR" will still exist - but will be localised to the compilation
units which need it.  The same should happen with SH.

So, as for this patch, that's a NAK.
