Yeah, sorry for not giving you a heads up on this before. Hopefully
it's just a bootstrap issue this first merge window that you're
sending things through our tree.

In general we don't mind seeing each branch separately, and having
dependencies between them is perfectly fine. Other subarch trees do
this all the time. So having the core updates as a prereq (and
included in) the two SoC names is perfectly fine, the dependencies
will carry over to how we merge them into our next/* branches in
arm-soc.

Again, that's fine. We have a "waterfall" of dependencies through the
arm-soc next/* branches and this will normally fit right in.

To see how we organize (and document) the branches we have pulled in,
take a look at arch/arm/arm-soc-for-next-contents.txt in the for-next
branch of the arm-soc tree:

http://git.kernel.org/?p=3Dlinux/kernel/git/arm/arm-soc.git;a=3Dblob;f=3Dar=
ch/arm/arm-soc-for-next-contents.txt;h=8Ca6bef667fa81c355a0a9200804d20c1617=
3f2d;hb=3Drefs/heads/for-next

In general, the document is sorted such that the prerequisites for
later branches are listed above. In some cases it means that we need
to have more than one topic branch due to otherwise circular or
awkward dependencies, for example next/dt and next/dt2.


General organization and order tends to start out as:

* cleanups
* fixes
* device tree updates
* core soc support (new socs, etc)
* soc drivers and soc-related items. This time we split them up a bit
(pm, pinctrl, clock, drivers)
* boards (generally very limited new board introductions, mostly updates)

But over time order can be somewhat reshuffled due to added dependencies.


The for-next and next/* branches are not guaranteed to be stable,
since we have in the past had to drop branches and rebuild them. In
general, downstream developers should be basing their work on the
specific subarch trees and not on arm-soc. There are a few exceptions
for tree-wide cleanups but even then, basing it on regular mainline
makes much more sense.
