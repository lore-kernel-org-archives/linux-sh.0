Yeah, I agree. I hope to discuss this in person later this Autumn.

I suppose negotiation has to happen on some level, and I appreciate
the higher level give-and-take approach that Arnd has been taking. At
this time though, apart from common clocks, extended DT support and
multiplatform I'm not so sure what desired cleanup-wise.

Yep. Thanks for your comments!
