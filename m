According to the manual there's some configuration possible,
though it's not verbosely described:
* SSCG (on/off)
* Clock connection (AC/DC)
* Termination Resistor (on/off)

AFAIU, this describes how the external clock generator is connected.
All available Gen2 boards use the same generator type and
the same "default" phy settings (SSCG off/DC/TR on).

It is possible set spread spectrum with a switch on the board (it is 
disabled by default)

I don't know if we will need to change those settings in the future.
Probably this could be done as a separate patch if needed.

Right. I meant that there should be a separate patch that adds 
documentation for the already existing binding.
I think I'll make a couple of patches then:
* Adjust and document the existing bindings as Simon has suggested
* Add Gen2 support and document Ge2 bindings.

Thanks,
