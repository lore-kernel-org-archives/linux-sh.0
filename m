I believe that this fixes a problem that doesn't manifest.

It ensures that the clock required for the irqpin controller is available.
But as it is in practice the boot loader appears to make the clock
available and its been working due to that for several years. And I'm not
aware of anyone for whom it is not working without this patch.

My personal feeling is that you should just queue it up as a regular
non-bug-fix patch. Sorry for not making that clearer in the first place.
