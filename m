OK, so the solution is to put this in a seperate branch. But then when
platform maintainers start working with it the resulting changes will
most probably go to arch/arm. So if Linus doesn't want to pull a tree
that touches both drivers/clk and arch/arm, then either he has to pull
the clk branch first or we have to wait for the next merge window until
we can use it.

I prefer the former.

Best regards
Uwe
