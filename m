Subject: [PATCH v2 1/5] ARM: shmobile: lager: correct memory map value and syntax

The base address of the second memory region on the lager
board is 0x140000000. Update the tag used in the dts file accordingly.

Also correct a syntax error by using two comma-delimited 32 bit values
rather than a single 64 bit value.

This is a documentation fix and should have no run-time affect.

This problem was introduced when the second memory region
was added to the lager dts file by 62bc32a2573c4219
("ARM: shmobile: Include all 4 GiB of memory on Lager)" in v3.14.
