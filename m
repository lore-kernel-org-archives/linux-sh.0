Could you let me know the commit id of the working branch?

Thanks, I thought that I had tested that but clearly I was mistaken.

The problem appears to be caused by "ARM: shmobile: kzm9g: Populate
platform devices from device tree" which is present in topic/pinmux.

I will remove that branch from topic/all+next until the problem is resolved.
I have also removed the topic/eth_sh and topic/intc-of branches from
topic/all+next as they depend on topic/pinmux.

It is not obvious to me why you are using other patches.
