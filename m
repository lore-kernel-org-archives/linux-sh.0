Interesting work. We don't currently have a policy for this,
so we should first talk about whether the behavior that you
want is desirable. The alternative would be that everybody
who wants to build a platform-specific kernel out of
multi_v7_defconfig has to go through the extra work of not
only disabling the platforms but also the individual drivers
for the other platforms.

This is a bit tricky for drivers that may be shared between
a few platforms in multi_v7_defconfig but are meaningless
on the others. We could solve that by having more complex
dependencies for each of those drivers, but that is where
maintaining those gets really messy.

A related problem that I think is more significant is that
some platforms 'select' a particular driver and when you
disable the platform, that driver is suddenly removed from the
defconfig for all other platforms as well. This has bitten
us a few times in the past, and I'd really like to fix those
cases first.
