Absolutely the right thing to do.

The XIP stuff has been broken and getting in the way for a long time
now because of the preprocessor mess.  I've made several changes to
the linker script over the years, and each time I've ended up deciding
to I'll do the best job I can for XIP, but I'm not going to spend
too long making sure that it's correct - especially as there appeared
to be no users of it.  I wouldn't describe the current file as being
"maintainable" in any way - It has devolved into a total mess, and I
would like to see the XIP stuff gone from the non-XIP linker script
- and doing that should mean it's less likely for XIP to break.

I'd also like to see a lot more of the preprocessor gunk gone (or at
least cleaned up) in that file too...
