    Yes, there is. Unfortunately, I haven't tested the build with 
koelsch_defconfig...

    Not really -- only in order to link.

    Strictly speaking, this is not enough. I'm getting:

arch/arm/mach-shmobile/built-in.o: In function `koelsch_ksz8041_fixup':
platsmp-apmu.c:(.text+0xb8): undefined reference to `mdiobus_read'
platsmp-apmu.c:(.text+0xd0): undefined reference to `mdiobus_write'
arch/arm/mach-shmobile/built-in.o: In function `koelsch_init':
platsmp-apmu.c:(.init.text+0xa90): undefined reference to 
`phy_register_fixup_for_id'

So I guess the fixup function should be enclosed into #ifdef CONFIG_PHYLIB 
too. However, in practice this change seems enough (gcc probably drops unused 
static functions?)...

    I believe you meant to say it doesn't link too.

WBR, Sergei
