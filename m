Is L2 RAM retained on power down ?

Disabling L2 is not mandatory. And the code above (if L2 RAM is not
retained) can be simply

outer_disable

the cleaning is done in the PL310 disable function properly.

Two steps above are ok, as long as flush L1 does not push data on the
stack on entry and L1 clean routine does not need any dirty data present
in L1. Clearing C bit on A9 stops the core from searching the
cache so data writes should not be executed with C bit cleared and a
data cache still containing dirty lines. For the same reason the cache
cleaning routine should not require any data to execute since the data
can be sitting in the cache that is not searched anymore when the C bit
is cleared.

The sequence:

clear C bit
bl v7_flush_dcache_all

is better coded in assembly (in the cpu_suspend finisher, ie the
function you pass as cpu_suspend 2 argument) to control what you are doing.

The cache cleaning routine (v7_flush_dcache_all) does not require any
data to execute, so running it with C bit cleared is fine.

Use v7_invalidate_l1 here.

Again, it depends on L2 behaviour on shutdown, if it is retained or not.
If L2 RAM content is lost on power down the sequence above seems ok.

Post the code, happy to have a look.
