A common struct clk implementation will at least allow you to whittle
this number down a bit, but it's obviously not possible to attempt to
work with the generic infrastructure prior to it being merged. Given that
there is nothing ARM-specific about the patch series it doesn't much
matter which tree it ultimately gets merged through, so long as it's in
place for people to build on top of for the next merge window.

ARM has been the defacto owner for the clock bits to date, but between
clkdev and a common struct clk it's certainly possible to move to a clock
tree and treat it the same as any other subsystem. Moving things out of
arch/arm and in to more generic maintenance paths certainly reduces the
chance for abuse -- and also provides a path for driver stuff.

SH and ARM-based SH/R-Mobile CPUs already share a clock framework, which
I've slowly been refactoring in preparation for Jeremy's common struct
clk. With that merged I'll be able to kill off a couple hundred lines
from the existing implementation at least.

If you'd prefer not to be the guinea pig for the clock bits going in to
.40 I'm certainly happy to take them in a topic branch, convert my
platforms on top of that and send the bits off to Linus early in the
merge window.
