The reason is that I described in the above text. The PMB function is
completely different from the MMU function but both functions are on
the same IPMMU hardware module and sharing the register space. I think
that a driver using the PMB part which is not yet released should not
depend on the Linux's iommu interface, so I split the driver in two
files: the IPMMU platform driver part (in arch/arm/mach-shmobile/) and
Linux's iommu part (in drivers/iommu/).  For the IPMMU platform driver part,
do you have any suggestions other than arch/* where this should go? It is
a generic platform device.

OK, I will remove the paragraph.

I agree about this is hackish. I don't mean to make an excuse, but I
could not find good sample code because no other drivers in the
upstream kernel use the arm_iommu_attach_device() API.

But I will try to modify the driver to support for several IPMMU
instances.
