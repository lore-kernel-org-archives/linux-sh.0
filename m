Sure, I'm open to anything here. How would you like me to write the
code to make it easy for Simon and you to merge it?

I'm asking because most header files are used by both SoC code and
board code, and because of that I went with different changes for
different topic branches. So to cope with the topic branch split my
current patches do this:

1) Introduce workaround to allow new header location
2) Convert SoC files to using new header location
3) Convert Board files to using new header location
4) Move header files
5) Remove recently introduced workaround
6) Remove existing multiplatform include path workaround

I'm happy to change things around, but please let me know how you guys
would like to consume this change so I can decide what to write
against.

Thanks,
