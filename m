The bindings need to be documented under Documentation/devicetree/mmc

It's common to use dashes (-) instead of underscores (_) in properties

Also, no need to prefix with mmc. But also:

In the device tree, do these encode the capability of the controller,
or how the device under the controller is wired up? It's not uncommon
to have an 4-bit device on a controller that could possibly support
8-bit devices. It needs to be clear from the property name which is
which to not confuse everyone all the time.

"supports-sdio-interrupts"

This is a property of the card (well, how the card is connected), not
the controller, right? Again, see above regarding confusion.

This should be implicit from lack of interrupt property in the device node.

The GPIO specifiers should be able to encode polarity. Is this needed
for other cases as well?
