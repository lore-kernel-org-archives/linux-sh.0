Let me describes the scenarios we want to solve:
1. dma controllers with SW mux:
	In this case the dma controller has SW mux to connect to periphrals.
The mux is programmed to talk to a slave controller. SO we can grab any channel
from that controller, we just need to pass the mux value.
Ideally, in this scenario virtual channels should be described by driver (not
one per physical channel though) and driver uses mux values to transfer to
periphrals

2. dma controllers with hardwired channels:
	In this case you need a channel from a controller A and also channel X,
as it is hard wired to periphral. This is quite common in bunch of drivers.
In this case we just have to look for this channel.

3. MIX
	Yes, I believe we have controllers where they have SW mux as well as
hard wired.

In case of 1 and 3a(sw), we just need controller info
In 2 and3b we need both info

SO the idea was that DT, ACPI pdata etc just tells me that how the assignments
should be done and at runtime dmanegine just does that.

This is what I had in mind (more on same lines as above)
struct dmaengine_slave_map {
	char *dma;	/* dma controller */
	char *client;	/* client */
	int ch;		/* specfic channel id, NULL for SW muxes */
	int slave_id;	/* request line */
	struct dmaengine_slave_map_entries *entry;
};
https://lkml.org/lkml/2012/9/14/139

This way we just ask for a channel and dmaengine know what to do.

No filter functions, no multiple request methods etc.
