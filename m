Hi Olof, Hi Arnd,

please consider the following board enhancements for 3.8.

* This pull-request is based on an earlier request which I
  posted on the 1st and was merged yesterday: [GIT PULL v3] Renesas
  ARM-based SoC boards for v3.8

* This pull request replaces the one that I sent yesterday:
  [GIT PULL] Renesas ARM-based SoC boards for v3.8 #2

* Patch #2 of this series has a build-time dependency on
  the soc pull request that I sent a few minutes ago:
  [GIT PULL] Renesas ARM-based SoC for v3.8 #2

  In particular, "ARM: shmobile: marzen: add USB EHCI driver support"
  depends on "[PATCH 1/7] ARM: shmobile: r8a7779: PFC rename PENCx -> USB_PENCx"

* Patch 4 of this pull-request is a driver patch which is a dependency
  of patches 6 and 7 of this pull-request. I have spoken to the driver
  maintainer, Paul Mundt, and he has indicated that he thinks it
  is best to merge all in one go.

  In more detail:

  "sh: clkfwk: add sh_clk_fsidiv_register()" is a dependency of
  - "ARM: shmobile: sh7372: use sh_clk_fsidiv_register() for FSI-DIV clocks"
  - "ARM: shmobile: r8a7740: add FSI-DVI clocks"
