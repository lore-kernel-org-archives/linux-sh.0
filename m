Yes, this is also a possibility, but it seems only a little bit better. 
Why should a DT node on SoC vN have a compatible string with SoC vK for 
some random for an abstract user absolutely unrelated SoC version?... And 
that vK would be different for different devices... So on SoC v5 MMC can 
be compatible with with v1, sound with v2, camera with v3... Don't you 
think it would look like a mess?

Sure, I don't mean the top-level root compatibility, I mean device 
compatibility.
