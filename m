Hi Olof, Hi Kevin, Hi Arnd,

Please consider this Renesas ARM based SoC intc updates for v3.15.

Previously merging code for this driver was handled Paul Mundt
as part of his maintenance of SUPERH. However, SUPERH is in
the process of being orphaned. And as this driver is also listed
as being maintained by Magnus and myself as part of ARM/SHMOBILE ARM
I have picked up this patch.

If you would prefer not to handle this that is quite fine by me but in that
case I would appreciate advice on where I should send pull-requests.
