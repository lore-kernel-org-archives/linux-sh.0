No, that's exactly the problem. We absolutely do not want to write 
compatible="vendor,soc-v1"; in a .dts file for SoC v2 just because we 
currently think, that we don't have to distinguish between those SoC 
versions in this specific driver. I think we all know it quite well, that 
there are (practically) always differences - sometimes documented, 
sometimes undocumented. And if you later find out, that you do have to 
differentiate in the driver - it's too late. Even if we disregard the 
argument of ugliness of having to set compatibility with soc-v1, soc-v2, 
soc-v3 in different DT nodes on an SoC v4.
