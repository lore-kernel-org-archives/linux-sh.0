So I'll consider your comment to patch 33/57 to be addressed :-)

You're right, sh_mobile_fb_reconfig() doesn't set the bits_per_pixel (and 
other format-related) field. I'll fix this by initializing those fields from 
the current var in sh_mobile_fb_reconfig() in patch 30/57, as that's the one 
that introduces the problem.
