Thanks!

I looked into adding a proper cache-controller node in DT.
While l2c_aux_mask can indeed be ~0, we still need a non-zero l2c_aux_val
to set L2C_AUX_CTRL_SHARED_OVERRIDE.
Alternatively, should there be a DT property to set this flag?

Note that I only try to preserve the register value before and after
migrating to generic l2c OF initialization. I did read (part of) the pl310
documentation, but it's still not clear to me if we really need
L2C_AUX_CTRL_SHARED_OVERRIDE. Perhaps this was just copied from
somewhere else without much afterthought?

Note that OMAP2+ has just made the switch, too, keeping
L2C_AUX_CTRL_SHARED_OVERRIDE, in commit 944e9df1d4f71f94 ("ARM: 8257/1:
OMAP2+: use common l2cache initialization code").

Thanks again!

Gr{oetje,eeting}s,
