I see. I guess someone understand the effect of this flag.
Does it make a difference on the machine you are looking at?

I've read the spec at http://infocenter.arm.com/help/topic/com.arm.doc.ddi0246a/DDI0246A_l2cc_pl310_r0p0_trm.pdf
on the topic but couldn't make sense of it to understand whether a
particular setting might be required for specific hardware or might
be a performance optimization.
