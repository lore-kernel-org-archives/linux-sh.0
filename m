Hi Greg!

First -- as you probably have guessed already -- I'm not (not yet?) :-)
too familiar with the Linux kernel patch submission process.  I have
spent quite some time reading the included documentation, but apparently
missed some details...  :-)

Sorry.  ``sh: machvec IO death.'' -- well, the essential part what I'm
fixing here is that before this commit readw (and friends, such as
ioread16) didn't do any endianess modification of the data, but directly
invoked __raw_readw, whereas after 37b7a978 they do such modification by
means of filtering through le16_to_cpu (in the readw/ioread16 case).
This is where things break for big endian (but not little endian, where
this is a no-op).

I'm assuming that Paul Mundt will handle the whole lot in an SH tree.

Paul, by the way, if that's more convenient I can also publish my Git
tree.

Yes.  By means of scripts/get_maintainer.pl (and some manual adjustments)
I created the Cc: lists that are part of my commits' log messages.  Then,
I just had git send-email send that out, without explicitly specifying a
primary recipient (To: line).  I assume I should have put Paul there?

On this patch, the linux-serial was Cced (as suggested by
scripts/get_maintainer.pl), as it touches a TTY/serial driver, and I
wanted to make sure to give you an opportunity to review that the patch
doesn't introduce any breakage on non-SH architectures, for example.
(Despite its indicative name, sh-sci also seems to be used on some ARM
boards.)


> confused,

Sorry; will hopefully improve.  :-)
