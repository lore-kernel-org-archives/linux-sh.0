From the R-Car Gen2 manual:

8. Reset (RST)
8.1 Features
The following functions are implemented by RST.
[...]
Latching of the levels on mode pins when PRESET# is negated
Mode monitoring register

7. Clock Pulse Generator (CPG)
7.2 Input/Output Pins
Table 7.1 lists the CPG pin configuration.
Table 7.1 Pin Configuration and Functions of CPG
Pin Name Function I/O Description
[...]
MD0 Mode 0 ...

Hence there definitely is a link between the (latched) values in the RST module
and CPG configuration. This link is expressed using the "renesas,modemr"
property, where the phandle provides the link to the RST block, and the
register offset provides a way for software to read the configuration.

What format would the boot mode value be in? One u32 word, an array
of u32s?
