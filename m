	Hi Simon, Magnus,

This patch series moves the setup of the GPIO-PFC pin mapping for
Renesas PFC/GPIO combos from C code to DT, and does some cleanups.
The move to DT is needed to make the GPIO hogging mechanism work, cfr.
the discussion following "[PATCH] [RFC] gpio: Retry deferred GPIO
hogging on pin range change" (https://lkml.org/lkml/2015/6/16/455).

The series consists of 3 parts:
  a. Patches 1-3 add the missing "gpio-ranges" properties to the dtsi
     files for all affected SoCs,
  b. Patch 4 disables the C code to set up the mapping on DT platforms
     (it's still needed on SH or ARM-legacy),
  c. Patches 5-6 do a few more cleanups in the sh-pfc gpio code.

Changes compared to v1 ("[PATCH 0/7] ARM: shmobile: Move gpio ranges
from C code to DT",
http://lists.infradead.org/pipermail/linux-arm-kernel/2015-June/353124.html):
  - Add check for CONFIG_OF and pfc->dev->of_node,
  - #ifdef out the code instead of introducing helper and dummy
    functions,
  - Drop "pinctrl: sh-pfc: Move sh_pfc_add_gpiochip() up", as it's no
    longer needed due to the #ifdefs,
  - Add Acked-by.

Dependencies:
  - This series applies against renesas-devel-20150803-v4.2-rc5,
  - Part a must go in first, to avoid regressions,
  - While I didn't notice any bad behavior by having part a only, part b
    should go in immediately after part a. Hence I think it's best if
    Simon can take this one, too.
  - Part c is independent (it doesn't touch the same code), so it can go
    in before or after the other parts, or in parallel.

Given this fixes the LCD on r8a7740/armadillo, which is a regression
introduced by the removal of armadillo-legacy support, I think at least
patch 2 should be queued for v4.3.

Thanks for applying!
