I used 0x43000000 as this is a 64-bit type. The OF PCI range code 
currently treats both 32 and 64-bit types the same way, but I thought it 
would be good to set this in case we ever need to use it.

Since the OF PCi range code treats both 32 and 64-bit types the same way, 
my PCIe driver only creates 64-bit mappings. In addition, the PCIe 
controller has to use a 64-bit mapping for anything over 2GiB. Based on 
this, I think it's sensible to leave the mappings as 1-to-1.

Thanks
