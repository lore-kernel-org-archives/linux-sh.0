In some sense this is a fix. But I don't think anyone is suffering from it.
Just poor guys like me who disable all MSTP clocks in early boot code,
to find more missing clock declarations and more drivers that don't manage
their clocks ;-)

I guess that would be:

    ARM: shmobile: INTC External IRQ pin driver on sh73a0

But I don't think it's worth adding that, or do you plan to backport
this to LTSI?

Note that you'd also have to backport the following to make this work:
