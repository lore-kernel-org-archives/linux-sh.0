From my side I think we should let our users decide for themselves. So
to me it would make sense to be able to assign various devices like
UART, SPI and I2C to whatever pins that the user wants during run
time, and use DT to point out what the hardware possibilities look
like. Right now we describe one setting in DT, and it smells like a
software policy to me. =)
