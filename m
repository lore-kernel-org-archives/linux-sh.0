[resent with the list and other original recipients this time]

I have the csum_partial_copy_from_user issue too, but with radvd (which sen=
ds
ipv6 packets). ipv4 networking is fine on the other hand. The kirkwood
platform I use does have checksum offload for ipv4 only and not ipv6 so the
csum functions will get called in the ipv6 case.
