The assumption is made if there isn't a cpu_disable (now
cpu_can_disable) op. See platform_cpu_disable() in
arch/arm/kernel/smp.c. If there isn't such a limitation on a particular
platform, the platform needs to set the cpu_disable/cpu_can_disable op
and indicate that there isn't a limitation (by returning 1 for example).
