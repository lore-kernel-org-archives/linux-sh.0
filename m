Quoting Linus:

| herring.

| THAT IS NOT WHY I STARTED TO COMPLAIN!

So we need to work on infrastructure, and the clock API is exactly that.  
Obviously adding it will increase the number of lines of code initially, 
but eventually this will help _reduce_ them, and more importantly it 
will allow for the reduction of mindless duplication of code that was 
identified as being the actual problem causing maintenance pain.
