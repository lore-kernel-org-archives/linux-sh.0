Hi,


*** This series is wip and does not currently function
    I am posting to provide a status update and ask for help ***

this is a second pass at at providing a refernce DT implementation
for the kzm9g baord which is intended to act as a guide for mach-shmobile
developers.

Major difference to v1:

* Drop touchscreen initialisation, it requires INTC
* Drop SDHI initialisation, the driver seems to need some work
* Add extra entries to clock-sh73a0.c:lookups[] and
  remove auxdata. Ultimtely the clocks will be described
  in DT, but the code isn't there yet.
* Drop MMCIF patch, it is not needed if regulators are enabled
* Drop PCF hacks, instead, the series is based on Laruent Pinchart's * series:
  [PATCH v2 00/77] SH pin control and GPIO rework with OF support
* Use shmobile_setup_delay()


Unfortunately the last point seems to introduce problems.
It seems to prevent SMP from booting to the point of printing
anything on the early console. And with CONFIG_SMP disabled
the boot halts when the MMCIF driver initialisation calls mmc_delay().

I've poked around a bit but I haven't had any luck working out
why this is the case. I would appreciate any pointers on what to
investigate.
