Hi Olof, Hi Kevin, Hi Arnd,

Please consider these Renesas ARM based SoC defconfig fixes for v3.20.

This pull request is based on "Second Round of Renesas ARM Based SoC
Defconfig Updates for v3.20", tagged as renesas-defconfig2-for-v3.20, which
you have previously pulled.


That pull-request was comprised of a single patch "ARM: shmobile: Enable
kzm9g board in multiplatform defconfig" which updated the mach_shmobile
based on the output of make savedefconfig run on a tree with sh73a0/kzm9g
multiplatform support present. And due to REGULATOR being indirectly
selected by Kconfig with that support prsent it was not present in the
resulting shmobile_defconfig.

However, sh73a0/kzm9g multiplatform supportsupport is no longer queued up
for v3.20 and thus is not enabled by make shmobile_defconfig resulting at
least in SDHI not working on boards based on R-Car Gen2 SoCs.

It may have been better if I had held off on the patch in question
until sh73a0/kzm9g multiplatform support was merged, something I expected
to occur for v3.20. But things being as they are this pull-request
provides a simple fix for the fallout.
