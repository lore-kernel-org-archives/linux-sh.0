Did you find a situation that would require pciehp.disable?  I hesitate to
add it because if there's a problem and pciehp.disable fixes it, people
tend to think the solution is "boot with pciehp.disable."  But the *real*
solution is to fix whatever is broken in the kernel, so no parameter is
needed at all.

> BTW we don't have any description for acpiphp.disable anywhere.

True.  I'll give you my opinion; Rafael may have a different one.

I don't know whether it's a good idea to add a description or not, for the
same reason as above.  I think we should actively discourage people from
using kernel parameters, except for debugging purposes and for some legacy
issues where there's no way for the kernel to figure things out by itself.
But in my opinion, acpiphp isn't in any of those categories, so I'm content
to have the parameter present but undocumented.  It seems more likely that
we'll hear about issues then, and we might be able to do something about
them.
