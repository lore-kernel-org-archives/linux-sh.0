The problem is not about _when_ to suspend (which autosuspend is about),
but _what_ _state_ to go when suspended.  That's quite a different issue.

No, I don't want that.  I want the device to be suspended when possible,
but I don't want that to cause the system to go into an overly deep power
state as a result.

I'm not sure what scenario you have in mind.  Care to elaborate?

Yes, it is.  Also, the number used here is somewhat arbitrary.

However, since no one except for SH7372 is now using device PM QoS, no one
else will be affected by this change at the moment.

Thanks,
