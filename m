I think PM gets it slightly wrong, the way you have to use #ifdef leads
to subtle bugs all the time, and I actually have a patch that converts
a few dozen drivers to use __maybe_unused to shut up build warnings and
errors.

What you can do though is to use a reference like

#define __i2c_slave_ptr(x) (IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_I2C_SLAVE) ? (x) : NULL)

	...
	.reg_slave = __i2c_slave_ptr(em_i2c_reg_slave),
	.unreg_slave = __i2c_slave_ptr(em_i2c_unreg_slave),
	...

This has the same effect as the __maybe_unused annotation.
