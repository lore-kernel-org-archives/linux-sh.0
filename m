At last I managed to get twd running with a recent (of 27.02) all+next 
snapshot on kzm9g with DT (reference) and actually I'm not really sure the 
problem is there. At least definitely not as bad as I saw it last time. To 
remind, the problem I observed was, that at lower CPU speeds a simple 
shell script, consisting of 20 20-second sleep calls was gaining multiple 
seconds, was taking more like 405 seconds, than 400. Now I only see it 
going to 401 seconds. This is still not good, but I need a more precise 
comparison to actually decide, whether this problem only appears at lower 
CPU speeds or it is always there. I'll look further into it next week.

Thanks
Guennadi
