Maybe we can get more deeper into it then :)
Platform have something like this in their target()

A. If new freq is more than old: Increase voltage
B. Change freq
C. If new freq is less than old: decrease voltage

Now, two concurrent calls to target are X and Y, where X is trying to increase
freq and Y is trying to decrease it..

And this is the sequence that followed due to races..

X.A: voltage increased for larger freq
Y.A: nothing happened here
Y.B: freq decreased
Y.C: voltage decreased
X.B: freq increased
X.C: nothing happened..

We ended up setting a freq which is not supported by the voltage we have
set.. That will probably make clock to CPU unstable and system wouldn't
be workable anymore...

And so I think even this case must also get some space in the changelog :)
