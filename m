Recent renesas-drivers sound has many conflicts, and sound
has strange behavior. I had tried it before and noticed.
I'm not sure latest one, but it has conflict log.
I'm using a littile older kernel, because of above reason.

Anyway, I tried below, and I could get sound.
(Limited sound only, because we are lacking CS2000 driver)

I will send ${PATCH-SET} soon
