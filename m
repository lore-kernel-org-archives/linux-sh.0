Hi,

This is a third pass at a two line fix for a regression in TMU clock
configuration.

I have managed to track down a portion of the documentation which
confirms the discussion on the mailing list: TMU01, TMU01 and TMU02
share a common clock.

I have also added a second patch to the series to exercise TMU02.
