Subject: [PATCH 05/25] ARM: shmobile: r8a7793: remove deprecated #gpio-range-cells

Commit a1bc260bb5f5d9 ("gpio: clean up gpio-ranges documentation")
declares the above property deprecated. That was more than 2 years ago.
Remove it, so it doesn't get copied around needlessly.

Based on similar work for the r8a7791 and r8a7794 by Wolfram Sang.
