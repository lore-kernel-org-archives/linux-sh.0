That's due to sh7372_init_pm_domains() being protected by #ifdef CONFIG_PM,
while rmobile_init_domains() is a dummy macro if !CONFIG_PM_RMOBILE.

I think the first #ifdef should also test for CONFIG_PM_RMOBILE, to be
consistent.

However, I don't see the warning with my current tree, nor with next-20140910,
as both are selected with mackerel_defconfig, due to:

 config ARCH_RMOBILE
        bool
        select PM_RMOBILE if PM && !ARCH_SHMOBILE_MULTI

Perhaps this change hadn't trickled from Simon's tree into your tree, due
to following a different merge path?

Gr{oetje,eeting}s,
