Instantiate iic(b) controllers in r8a7793 device tree.

Based on similar work for the r8a7791 and r8a7791 by Wolfram Sang.

The out-of order aliasing of iic to i2c is as per the documentation.
This differs from the scheme in use in the dtsi files for
other R-Car SoCs.

It would be nice to harmonise this somehow but I'm unsure of the backwards
compatibility issues.

For reference those aliases are:

* r8a7790:
  - i2c0 = &i2c0;
  - i2c1 = &i2c1;
  - i2c2 = &i2c2;
  - i2c3 = &i2c3;
  - i2c4 = &iic0;
  - i2c5 = &iic1;
  - i2c6 = &iic2;
  - i2c7 = &iic3;

  Notes:
  - The documentation does not make note of i2c aliases for iic
    (v1.02, table 12.2.1)
  - i2c4 and i2c5 are not present on this SoC

* r8a7791:
  - i2c0 = &i2c0;
  - i2c1 = &i2c1;
  - i2c2 = &i2c2;
  - i2c3 = &i2c3;
  - i2c4 = &i2c4;
  - i2c5 = &i2c5;
  - i2c6 = &i2c6;
  - i2c7 = &i2c7;
  - i2c8 = &i2c8;

  Notes:
  - i2c is used in place of iic and it is my understanding that
    i2c6 is iic0, i2c7 is iic1 and i2c8 is iic3.
  - iic3 is not present on this SoC
  - Documentation makes note of (v1.02, table 12.2.1).
    They are the same as those used in this patch for the r8a7793

* r8a7794:
  - i2c0 = &i2c0;
  - i2c1 = &i2c1;
  - i2c2 = &i2c2;
  - i2c3 = &i2c3;
  - i2c4 = &i2c4;
  - i2c5 = &i2c5;

  Notes:
  - iic0 and iic1 nodes not present in mainline but are present on this SoC
  - Documentation makes note of the following aliases (v1.02, table 12.2.1)
    - iic6 = &iic0
    - iic8 = &iic1
  - iic2 and iic3 are not present on this SoC
