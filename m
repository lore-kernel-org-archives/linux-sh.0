Subject: [PATCH] [RFC] ARM: shmobile: sh73a0 dtsi: Add Cortex-A9 TWD node

Add a node for the Private Timer and Watchdog, as found in the Cortex-A9
MPCore.

Without this, there's no clocksource available during early kernel
initialization, before cmt1 is initialized, leading to a lock-up if
CONFIG_CPU_IDLE=y.

FIXME The clock should be the PERIPH clock, but the sh73a0 CPG driver
      doesn't have support for that clock yet. Hence we use the ZG
      clock, which runs at the same frequency.

Unlike "arm,armv7-timer" (used on R-Car Gen2), "arm,cortex-a9-twd-time"
does require a clock, which is not documented in its bindings?
