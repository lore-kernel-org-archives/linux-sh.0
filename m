I agree that parameters related to the instantiation of a GPIO IP core in a 
SoC should come from DT. Parameters related to the IP core version (usch as 
the ability to trigger on both edges) should in my opinion be computed by the 
GPIO driver based on the IP core version number.

Agreed. Are the version numbers for the GPIO IP core available ?
