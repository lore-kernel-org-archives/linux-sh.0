The first of these patches is a bug-fix, whereas the latter three patches 
are experimental and might want to be discussed. This patch set is based 
on an earlier Simon's topic/all+next branch snapshot. Attempts to use 
todays checkout failed - I couldn't even boot. Obviously, I'm also using 
my AS3711 patches and a number of other (not directly related) patches, 
that I'll be posting separately.

Guennadi Liakhovetski (4):
  ARM: shmobile: sh73a0: fix Z and ZG clock hierarchy
  ARM: shmobile: sh73a0: add support for adjusting CPU frequency
  ARM: shmobile: sh73a0: run sh73a0_clock_init() only once
  ARM: shmobile: kzm9g-reference: add CPUFreq support
