Tony and I talked about this quite a bit during the last Connect.  The
plan is to extend the existing bootwrapper ATAGs to DT code to allow
appending multiple .dtbs to the zImage and selecting the correct one
based on the machine number.  It shouldn't be very complicated, but I
haven't had time to implement it.
