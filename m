Hi Catalin,

I have discussed this the issue that you raised above with the platform
team that provided me with the workaround. Although they have not encountered a
situation in which the errata is hit they would like the workaround
considered for merging as it is needed for compliance with customer
requirements, in this case an automotive customer (I do not know which one).
