Unfortunately this breaks earlycon support:

        Malformed early option 'earlycon'

The call to fdt_getprop() in early_init_dt_scan_chosen_serial() fails.
I guess that unlike the standard console handling code, the fdt code can't
handle aliases yet?

P.S. SCIF earlycon support is not yet upstream, as it still doesn't work on
arm32 (I discovered today it does on arm64 ;-): it pretends to work, but
nothing is output to the serial port (until the normal serial console kicks
in).

Gr{oetje,eeting}s,
