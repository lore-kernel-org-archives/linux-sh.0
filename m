ARM: mach-shmobile: DT_MACHINE and mach-type updates

[PATCH 01/03] mach-shmobile: Use DT_MACHINE for KZM9G
[PATCH 02/03] mach-shmobile: Use DT_MACHINE for armadillo 800 eva
[PATCH 03/03] ARM: Undelete KZM9D mach-type

These patches contain a few last minute updates for mach-shmobile.
There are two patches that convert recently added boards to make use
of DT_MACHINE_START(). Also, slightly unrelated to the new boards,
but the KZM9D mach-type is undeleted as well. This to allow build
of the EMEV2-based KZM9D board.
