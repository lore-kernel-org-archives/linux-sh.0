	Hi Simon, Magnus,

The KZM-A9-GT and Armadillo-800 EVA boards are now sufficiently
supported by DT-based and board-less SH-Mobile AG5 (sh73a0) and R-Mobile
A1 (r8a7740) multi-platform kernels.

Lacking areas are:
  - USB (it does't work in legacy, neither),
  - HDMI on armadillo (it doesn't work in legacy, neither),
  - Camera on armadillo (we don't care),
  - LCDC:
      - on armadillo, this is supported by the board staging code,
      - on kzm9g, the LCDC is wired to the legacy INTC, which is not
	planned to be supported with DT,
  - DMAC/IPMMU (no DT bindings are planned).

Hence this patch series removes legacy board and SoC code for
sh73a0/kzm9g and r8a7740/armadillo.

It consists of 4 parts:
  - Patches 1-4 remove legacy support for kzm9g (board code, defconfig,
    dtb) and sh73a0,
  - Patches 5-8 remove legacy support for armadillo (board code,
    defconfig, dtb) and r8a7740,
  - Patches 9-11 remove generic shmobile support code (dma-register.h,
    legacy PM Domains, zboot) that became unused by the removal of
    legacy sh73a0/kzm9g and r8a7740/armadillo,
  - Patches 12-15 remove legacy sh73a0 and r8a7740 support in the
    pinctrl drivers.

Dependencies:
  - This is against next-20150617,
  - To keep up with existing LCDC functionality for armadillo-legacy,
    the r8a7740/armadillo part (and later parts) depends on "[PATCH v2
    0/7] staging: board: armadillo800eva: Board staging for
    sh_mobile_lcdc_fb" (https://lkml.org/lkml/2015/6/17/115).
    However, it can be applied as-is now, and board staging can he
    handled in parallel (if at all).

Thanks for applying!
