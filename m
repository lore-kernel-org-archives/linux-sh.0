Hm, I wonder if I reversed the logic by mistake, but I don't think so.
The idea is that dx should be set to -1 by default and stay that way
unless write/blit/* has been used. After each deferred io work dx is
reset to -1. If dx is not -1 in the deferred io callback then we need
to refresh the area specified by dx, dy, width, height _and_ the
pages. The xen driver does this.

In the metronome driver case we update the entire screen if dx has
been set which means we can skip the pages since they are considered
part of the entire screen. This should be the same behavior as before,
the local write/bit/* functions all call metronome_dpy_update()
without this patch.

Or maybe my logic is broken?

Btw, patch [1/5] is somewhat broken today with the handling of
sysdelay vs delay. Ideally I'd like to get rid of sysdelay and let
write/blit/* use the same delay as mmap(). Not sure if you are keen on
that though since it changes the behavior of your drivers. Otoh that
may make fbcon usable on e-paper since it decouples the soft cursor
refresh rate from the screen refresh rate.

Excellent, thanks!
