...and then you'd have to add pointers to these functions to the tmio=20
struct to be able to call them from the core (*_pio) and check it for NULL =

and-and-and... And this instead of just one test for resource size >=20
0x100. Do you really think it's worth it? Basically, when your code has to =

act differently in different situations you can either check some=20
parameters, set by the environment, or, in more complicated cases, call=20
some environment callback. I think this case is still simple enough - you=20
even don't have to add any new parameters - they are already there - the=20
resource size. You just have to check it.

We might well need some callbacks in the future, when we implement=20
multiple interrupts or some even more significant differences, but this=20
looks like a really simple thing to me, and your approach makes it a bit=20
overly complicated, don't you think?
