There's one difference between the fixed and the dummy regulator though:
The fixed regulator has a voltage. The same dummy regulator instance can
be used for all devices which do not have a software controllable
regulator. I think the same can be done with the fixed regulator aswell,
but the bogus voltage showing up in the sysfs entry might be confusing
to users.
That's the reason I implemented a (second) dummy regulator driver.
Indeed it's not nice to have two of them.

Another approach to this topic would be to allow a board to explicitely
bind to the existing dummy regulator, like the following (error path
should of course be implemented before applying this)
