I assume you meant the currently developed 3.1? (as 3.2 is the next one for
which the patch is lying in my fbdev-next anyway)
Uhm, I originally didn't plan to ask Linus pulling anything before getting rid
of the old stuff, but okay, will go through my patches in the next days and look
what else is appropriate unless Linus beats me and releases 3.1 (although I do
not consider this likely as long as kernel.org is still down)
