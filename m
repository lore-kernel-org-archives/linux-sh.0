A few thoughts:

1) Does this property indicate that:

a) The current state of the backlight at boot. In which case, this will
need bootloader involvement to modify the value in the DT at boot time
based on whether the bootloader turned on the backlight:-(

b) That the driver should not turn on the backlight immediately? That
seems to describe driver behaviour more than HW. Is it appropriate to
put that into DT?

Your suggestion to make the backlight not turn on by default might be a
better fix?

2) Should the driver instead attempt to read the current state of the
GPIO output to determine whether the backlight is on? This may not be
possible on all HW.

3) Doesn't the following code in probe() (added in a previous patch)
need to be updated?

... That assumes that the backlight is on at boot, and hence presumably
after this patch still always turns on the backlight, only to turn it
off very quickly once the following code in this patch executes:

(and perhaps we also need to avoid turning the backlight off then on if
it was already on at boot)
