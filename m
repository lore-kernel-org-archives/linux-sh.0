I've rolled these patches in as well, with some minor cleanups and
dependency fixups.

As none of the CPUs presently enable this yet, this will remain fairly
experimental, but it's enough to get people playing with it under 2.6.34.
We'll have to do some more iterative changes for 2.6.35, as well as
gradually getting it wired up on more CPUs, in addition to making it
configurable per-channel. This also gives us the time to get the
dmaengine API extensions worked out with Dan.
