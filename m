Many thanks for your review comments!

It should not cause problems, as long as sh7734 doesn't add the optional
clocks ;-)

I'll do that. Note that there's no chaining of BRGs, only muxing (so yes, it
needs more clarification ;-).

There can be 4 possible sources for the sampling clock:
  1. Internal BRG (BRR register),
  2. (H)SCK,
  3. BRG for external clock
      a. Using SCIF_CLK,
      b. Using the bus clock.

Gr{oetje,eeting}s,
