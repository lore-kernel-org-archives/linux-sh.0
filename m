    Simon, what's up with this series? You've merged analogous series for 
R8A7790 but not this one. You followed up to an older version of it, asking me 
to re-post when the driver patch gets merged but it already had been merged 
already (and this version posted), and I got no reply from you then...

WBR, Sergei
