Thank you!  I shall attempt to debug.  Was this with a btrfs root
filesystem?  I'm most suspicious of those patches right now, since they've
received next to no testing.  I'm going to put together a smaller patchset
which just does the page cache conversion and nothing else in the hope
that we can get that merged this year.
