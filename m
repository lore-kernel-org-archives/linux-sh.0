This is version 6 of a PCIe Host driver for the R-Car Gen2 devices,
i.e. R-Car H2 (r8a7790) and R-Car M2 (r8a7791).

v6:
 - Correct DT bindings description for reg and clocks
 - Split device and board DT changes
 - Add shmobile to subject for shmobile DT patches
 - Don't check MSI irq number is valid, as upper level checks this
 - Change "Unexpected MSI" msg to debug level
 - Reword "Unexpected MSI" comment so that it's one line
 - Remove patch that adds HAVE_ARM_ARCH_TIMER to koelsch defconfig as not needed

v5:
 - Use module_platform_driver instead of subsys_initcall
 - Use the of_device_id data field for HW init function
 - Init hw_pci struct in declaration
 - Renesas SoC compatible string has peripheral before device name
 - Add PCIe bus clock reference
 - Use dma-ranges property to specify inbound memory regions
 - Support multiple IO windows and correct resources
 - Return IRQ_NONE from MSI isr when there is no pending MSI
 - Add additional interrupt bindings

v4:
 - Use runtime PM properly
