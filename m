Subject: [PATCH v3 0/3] CPUFreq for kzm9g

This is v3 of the patch-series, adding CPUFreq support to sh73a0 SoCs and 
to the kzm9g board specifically. It now consists of 3 patches instead of 2, 
as in v2. The first patch is new. It adds waiting to the clock-kicking 
operation for all clocks, controlled by the FRQCRA and FRQCRB operations. 
In principle, this means, that this change affects existing systems, but 
in fact, I don't think any of them currently actively configure rates of 
those clocks, at least I haven't found any occurrences in the mainline. So, 
the risk should be purely theoretical. Other changes are noted in 
respective patches.

Also note, that there seems to be a problem with the TWD clock, when 
adjusting the CPU rate. I'm posting these patches for now for reference, 
but they shouldn't be applied, until the problem is solved.

Thanks
Guennadi
