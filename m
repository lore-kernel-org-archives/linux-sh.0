This series aims to consolidate OMAP and SH-mobile runtime PM
implementations around the new device power domains.

In 2.6.39, device power domains were added (commit
7538e3db6e015e890825fbd9f8659952896ddd5b, PM: add support for device
power domains).  In converting both OMAP and SH-mobile to use device
power domains, the overlap between implementations was almost 100%.  

To share the runtime PM implementation based on simple clock gating,
move it to arch/arm/common and initialize it from OMAP and SH-mobile.

Also, OMAP was the only user of platform_bus_set_pm_ops().  Now that
it has been converted to device power domains, remove
platform_bus_set_pm_ops().

Kevin Hilman (6):
  ARM: sh-mobile: runtime PM: convert to device powerdomains
  OMAP2+: PM: move runtime PM implementation to use device power
    domains
  OMAP1: runtime PM: drop platform bus implementation
  ARM: move SH-mobile runtime PM to arm/common for sharing with other
    platforms
  ARM: use common clock-based runtime PM implementation on SH-mobile &
    OMAP1
  Revert "driver core: platform_bus: allow runtime override of
    dev_pm_ops"
