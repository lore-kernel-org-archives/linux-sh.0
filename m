Hello,

This patch set implements serial port support for the Lager reference board.

The code is available in my git tree at

        git://linuxtv.org/pinchartl/fbdev.git clocks/ccf/serial/boards

The patches are based on top of the "[PATCH 00/47] sh-sci updates for v3.14"
and "[PATCH v3 00/15] Lager and Koelsch multiplatform support" patch series.

Changes compared to v2:

- Added Koelsch support

Changes compared to v1:

- Removed early debugging support as it requires more work before being
  mainlined
