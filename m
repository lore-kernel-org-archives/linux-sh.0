Yes, that's OK.

It's unusual to do things this way - normally I'd just clump Erik's
patch and your changes to it into a single commit.  So we end up with
something which can be more effectively reviewed and a cleaner kernel
history.

But that's not a terribly important thing - if for some particular
reason you want to do it this way then that's OK by me.
