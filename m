Actually, thinking about this a little more, my patch actually does
select only relevant devices, and not *all* platform devices.

In my patch, the device power domain pointers are only added for devices
where a clk_get() actually succeeds.  In the original version, the
runtime PM hooks are overridden for *all* platform devices, but ones
that have no clock (or where clk_get() failed) have the additional
overhead of still calling the custom PM ops, but the custom ops have
nothing to do.
