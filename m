Yes, they should be named ethernet. Rename when you have a chance and/or are
touching the files for other nearby changes.

Also, the 9220 chips are usually located on a general-purpose external parallel
bus, but they're not modelled that way here. You might want to add proper
bindings for future devices on said busses (handling chipselects, etc, as
needed).
