Hmm, complex indeed.

Is there any way to avoid this sequence of ARM -> sh/pinctrl -> ARM ->
sh/pinctrl dependencies? That's what really makes things look complicated
here. If you could move the final cleanup/code removal pieces out of
the sh/pinctrl branches such that you have a less iterative chain of:

sh/pinctrl -> ARM -> final sh/pinctrl cleanup (removal of struct members, etc)

... but I haven't looked in detail at the per-patch dependencies to see how
tough that would be to arrange.

Looking at it from the end here, 10 contains only arch/sh and global
changes, and depends on 8 and 9. 8 also contains only sh changes. So it
looks like 8 and 10 could be pruned from this pull request and go through
either SH or pinctrl.

What pieces from branch 7 are stronly needed? A couple of the added pinctrl
modules are used by mach-shmobile boards, it seems. And the structure rename
might also be needed.

Not having to pull in the bulk of 7, 8 and 10 would make a pretty big
difference.

For branch 2 (clocksource include order), I'd like to see an ack from John or
Thomas. Does it really make sense to base that on an ifdef instead of always
initialize early?

Branch 4 seems to be mostly sh-specific updates. With some of the later
dependencies avoided, maybe this branch can be dropped too, not sure?

About half of branch 5 looks like it's generic SoC-updates unrelated
to the pinctrl rework, and branch 6 looks like mostly regular
patches/updates, is that stronly dependent on all the pinctrl
rework? Doesn't look like it should be?
