[PATCH/RFC 10/10] iommu/ipmmu-vmsa: Hook up r8a7795 DT matching code

Add experimental r8a7795 support for the IPMMU driver. At this point
the code is in rather early stages of development and not ready for
upstream merge. The DT binding is undocumented and will change.

The r8a7795 IPMMU is almost register compatible with earlier devices
like r8a7790-r8a7794, however some bitfields have been shifted
slightly. On a grander scale topology has been added and interrupts
have been reworked. So now there are several "cache" IPMMU units
without interrupt that somehow communicate with IPMMU-MM that
is the only instance that supports interrupts. The code refers to
IPMMU-MM as a "root" device and the other ones as leaf nodes.
In the future the plan is to use DT to describe the relationship.

To make this more interesting the IPMMU driver needs to be shared
between 32-bit ARM for r8a7790-r8a7794 and 64-bit ARM for r8a7795.
In practice this means that two separate implementations are needed
inside the driver to attach to the rather different architecture
specific code.

CONFIG_IOMMU_DMA=y is needed on 64-bit ARM while on 32-bit ARM
the arch specific dma-mapping code is hooked up rather directly.
During init 64-bit ARM IPMMU support is relying on IOMMU_OF_DECLARE().

The code is known to build on 32-bit and 64-bit ARM and x86_64.
Tested on 32-bit ARM and 64-bit ARM with addtional DT integration
changes.
