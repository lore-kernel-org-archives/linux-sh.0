Still, DT is supposed to describe the hardware. Even if the driver doesn't
use the description.

We do know the GIC is part of the power domain, and has a controllable
clock (on the affected SoCs).

I have no idea which GIC version is being used.

This is for Renesas R-Mobile APE6 (r8a73a4) and various R-Car Gen2.
According to the DTS, they're compatible with "arm,cortex-a15-gic" and
"arm,cortex-a7-gic", and work with that value.

Possibly (then we're gonna need subnodes, each with their own
power-domains properties?).

Unfortunately that's not documented...

Documentation/devicetree/bindings/arm/gic.txt doesn't mention any clocks
for GIC-400?

You can. But you have to be careful to avoid conflicts, as the controller
for the clock domain needs to know which clock to use.

On Renesas SoCs, we always used the first clock for power control.
For the future, we plan to use "fck" if it exists.

Yes, this can be complicated, as ideally it needs synchronization between
device DT bindings and platform (clock/power domain) DT bindings.

Please also note that any device (hardware IP core) can be reused on an
SoC that supports clock and/or power domains, and suddenly starts to rely
on power-domains and clocks properties.

Thanks!
