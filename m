Subject: [PATCH] mmc: sh_mmcif: mmc->f_max heuristic

In 930f152cc9998388031af577843baae572ac8ab6 ("mmc: sh_mmcif: mmc->f_max
should be half of the bus clock") I changed the setting of mmc->f_max from
the bus clock to half the bus clock based on the manual for the sh7372 SoC.

Inspection of sh_mmcif_clock_control() reveals that it relies on
mmc->f_max being set to the bus speed in order to enable the supplementary
clock, a feature that does not exist on the sh7372.

Armed with this information implement the following heuristic for setting
mmc->f_max:

* Use bus clock if the supplementary clock feature is present
  - Assumed to work on the sh7757lcr board, the only board present
    in the tree which has the feature.
* Use half the bus clock otherwise
  - As per the documentation for the sh7372 SoC.

Regression information:

It seems likely that this resolves a regression for the sh7757lcr which was
introduced by 930f152cc9998388031af577843baae572ac8ab6 ("mmc: sh_mmcif:
mmc->f_max should be half of the bus clock"). However, although I have the
hardware in question I am unsure how to exercise the code to test if there
is a problem or not.

930f152cc9998388031af577843baae572ac8ab6 was added between the 3.3 and 3.4.

Dependency information:

This patch is based on Guennadi Liakhovetski's recent series
"[PATCH 0/5 v4] mmc: sh_mmcif: clock and power updates". It should
be trivial to rebase it on 3.5-rc3.
