	Hi Simon, Magnus, Greg,

On several Renesas ARM SoCs, the GIC is described in DT as being a
Cortex A9 GIC, while it's actually a PL390. This is not only stated in
the documentation, but has been verified by reading the GICD_IIDR
register.

This series
  1. Corrects the DT compatible value to match reality,
  2. Updates the board staging drivers to match the above.

As both parts impact each other, I think it's best that all patches go
in through Simon's ARM/SHMOBILE tree.

Greg: can you please provide your ack for the last two patches?

Thanks!
