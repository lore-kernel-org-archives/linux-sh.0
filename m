Hi Rafael,

Thanks for your feedback!

I realize that I didn't explain very well why I decided to wrap
dev_pm_ops. Sorry about that. Basically there are two reasons:
1) Wrap to always have the runtime dev_pm_ops functions regardless of kconf=
ig.
2) Wrap to make sure runtime and system-wide dev_pm_ops can coexist.

I have to make sure that the right Kconfig bits are enabled though,
otherwise some platform_pm_* functions will be missing. So one merit
for the wrapped functions is in this patch is that they are always
there regardless of CONFIG_SUSPEND and CONFIG_HIBERNATION.

Is one flag really enough? Isn't it a bit strange from the driver
point of view to always get their ->prepare() callback executed, but
->suspend() gets filtered?

The bitmap in this patch is more fine-grained, so struct
platform_device remember which of each dev_pm_ops callback that have
been called. It may be overly complex though. Also, please note that
both runtime dev_pm_ops and system-wide dev_pm_ops go through the same
dev_pm_ops that keep track of which callbacks that have been called.

Using some kind of flag(s) for coexisting with system-wide
suspend-to-ram/disk sounds good.

We may need to do other things as well - not sure - but regardless we
still need flag(s) to avoid double suspend.

Yeah, that's also one way. I wonder if that helps us though, I feel
that we already have a pretty wide range of callbacks in dev_pm_ops.
I'm not sure if they cover all cases we need though, I guess future
experiments will tell.

Yeah, I wonder if a single flag is enough though? Aren't we coexisting
with CONFIG_SUSPEND, CONFIG_HIBERNATION and CONFIG_KEXEC_JUMP?

If I understand (1)-(3) correctly, then I think (1) is probably the
best choice for our platform devices. I guess (2) is not very far from
(1), so if we go with (1) to begin with then we can deal with SoC
specific things in our arch code to come closer to (2) over time if
needed.

That is true, but this checking is not needed for systems where
runtime PM is disabled. Or am I misunderstanding?

Maybe it's worth to discuss how to integrate this. I suspect that this
will only affect some selected architectures to begin with, and the
rest of the code base should be unaffected by this change as long as
the runtime kconfig is disabled.

So I decided to wrap dev_pm_ops to make the impact for non runtime PM
systems as small as possible. This while giving the runtime PM case
access to all dev_pm_ops regardless of suspend/hibernation kconfig.

Does it make sense?

Thank you!
