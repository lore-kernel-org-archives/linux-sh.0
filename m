Uhm, well, you can make the mapping more compact yes, but I'm not sure
if I agree that it becomes any better. Isn't it better to simply
follow the per-port setup that the manual defines? Is there an actual
problem with having unused GPIOs?

Actually, I prefer going in the opposite direction so I would like to
share the simple version of RZ_PORT_PIN() in a header file like we do
with RCAR_GP_PIN() in <linux/platform_data/gpio-rcar.h>. This because
we would like to use the same macro in the GPIO driver and in the
current PFC code (and potentially more PFCs using the same GPIO
driver).

Please let me know what you think.

Cheers,
