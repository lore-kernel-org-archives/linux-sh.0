Answering myself here, that's not an option, as the trigger function is called 
in atomic context (replacing the spinlock with a mutex produced a clear BUG) 
due to snd_pcm_lib_write1() taking a spinlock.

Now we have a core issue. On one side there's rsnd_soc_dai_trigger() being 
called in atomic context, and on the other side the function ends up calling 
dmaengine_prep_dma_cyclic() which needs to allocate memory. To make this more 
func the DMA engine API is undocumented and completely silent on whether the 
prep functions are allowed to sleep. The question is, who's wrong ?

Now, if you're tempted to say that I'm wrong by allocating memory with 
GFP_KERNEL in the DMA engine driver, please read on first :-) I've tried 
replacing GFP_KERNEL with GFP_ATOMIC allocations, and then ran into a problem 
more complex to solve.

The rcar-dmac DMA engine driver uses runtime PM. When not used, the device is 
suspended. The driver calls pm_runtime_get_sync() to resume the device, and 
needs to do so when a descriptor is submitted. This operation, currently 
performed in the tx_submit handler, could be moved to the prep_dma_cyclic or 
issue_pending handler, but the three operations are called in a row from 
rsnd_dma_start(), itself ultimately called from snd_pcm_lib_write1() with the 
spinlock held. This means I have no place in my DMA engine driver where I can 
resume the device.

One could argue that the rcar-dmac driver could use a work queue to handle 
power management. That's correct, but the additional complexity, which would 
be required in *all* DMA engine drivers, seem too high to me. If we need to go 
that way, this is really a task that the DMA engine core should handle.

Let's start by answering the background question and updating the DMA engine 
API documentation once and for good : in which context are drivers allowed to 
call the prep, tx_submit and issue_pending functions ?
