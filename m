Any pointer would be appreciated :-) How did you compute the various ratings 
used in platform data all over the place ?

That won't match the current situation. Look at CMT0 in r8a7790 for instance. 
There's two hardware channels available, and we only use the first one, for 
clock events only.

Yes, that's a configuration that needs to be specified somewhere. I don't know 
where though.
