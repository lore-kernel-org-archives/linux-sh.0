Well, gpio-ranges can contain several ranges, so, in a generic case you 
would have to sum them up to get a total count. But if you're ok with that 
or if your platforms only have 1 gpio gange per controller, of course, 
that property seems redundant. OTOH it is already used in r8a7779.dtsi, 
and thus already belongs to the ABI... Not sure whether removing it would 
be accepted.

Thanks
