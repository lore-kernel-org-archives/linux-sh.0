To clarify this, the current DT compatible strings policy for Renesas SoCs is 
to use a mandatory SoC-based string followed by a optional generic strings. 
Optional here refers to the fact that individual DT bindings can decide 
whether to use a generic string or not, based on hardware information. An IP 
core that has a different, incompatible implementation for each SoC it is 
present in can't make use of a generic compatible string. If a particular 
binding defines generic compatible strings those should be made mandatory by 
that binding.

In the MMCIF case, I would propose wording it as

- compatible: must contain one of the following
      - "renesas,mmcif-r8a7740" for the MMCIF found in r8a7740 SoCs
      - "renesas,mmcif-r8a7790" for the MMCIF found in r8a7790 SoCs
      - "renesas,mmcif-r8a7791" for the MMCIF found in r8a7791 SoCs
  followed by "renesas,sh-mmcif".
