One small comment on the definition of these register offsets and
explanation of what I was originally thinking.  Since each of these
actually reprents a series of registers, one per ICB, (i.e. ME00CTL,
ME01CTL, etc.) it makes sense to me to represent them as an offset from
the base address (0x400) + the start of each ICB address (0x20 * index).

Other than that, looks great.

Thanks very much,
Damian
