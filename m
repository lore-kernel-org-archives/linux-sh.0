I understood how the code is meant to work. It's just that IMO the place
where the propagation flag is stored is the wrong one, given that it's a
flag that all clocks (can) have.

Hm, the core could pass a NULL pointer as the third argument to
set_rate to indicate that the parent rate is not allowed to change.
Then we could initialize &parent_rate to zero before calling set_rate.
If the set_rate function does not change it, we don't have to propagate,
otherwise yes. Or instead we could just use the CLK_SET_RATE_PROPAGATE
return value like we do in the current version.
