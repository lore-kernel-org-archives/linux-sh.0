Right, there are a couple of entries across the place. My feeling is
that we can handle them independently for each driver.

I don't think we have any support upstream for that, but I recall
cooking up some prototype running two linux instances in separate
memory spaces and using virtio as mailbox interface in between. I also
recall that SH4AL-DSP CPU core tend to be a PITA to handle
toolchain-wise, but SH4 with FPU is much easier with current (or
yesteryear) toolchain. Exactly which SH core that is included in
sh7372 I'm not so sure about. =)
