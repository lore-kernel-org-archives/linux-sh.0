In general, I would agree, and remove the option at the blimp of an eye.
However, this driver is shared with H8/300 and SuperH.  While both could use
DMA (but it's not supported by Linux yet), I don't know if they are willing to
live with the increased static and dynamic memory footprint of SH_SCI DMA
support.

Whether we want to hide the option (and default to y if ARCH_RENESAS, i.e.
ARM) is another question.  Note that that wouldn't reduce code maintainability,
as the #ifdefs would be kept, and it would prevent building and testing
with/without DMA on ARM.

Gr{oetje,eeting}s,
