Hi Chris, Ian

AFAICS there are currently still a few tmio patch-series outstanding:

From: Guennadi Liakhovetski <g.liakhovetski <at> gmx.de>
Subject: [PATCH 0/2] tmio_mmc: improve DMA reliability
	http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel.mmc/6485

From: Simon Horman <horms <at> verge.net.au>
Subject: [PATCH 0/4] [rfc v3] mmc, ARM: Add zboot from eSD support for SuperH Mobile ARM
	http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel.mmc/6664

From: Guennadi Liakhovetski <g.liakhovetski <at> gmx.de>
Subject: [PATCH 0/6] mmc: split the tmio driver into several modules
	http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.ports.sh.devel/10304

From: Guennadi Liakhovetski <g.liakhovetski <at> gmx.de>
Subject: [PATCH 0/4 v2] mmc: tmio: don't access nonexisting registers
	http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.ports.sh.devel/10311

From: Guennadi Liakhovetski <g.liakhovetski <at> gmx.de>
Subject: [PATCH/RFC 0/2 v2] mmc: tmio: power management and clock gating
	http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel.mmc/6627

Of those the first patchset shouldn't have any issues.

I haven't followed discussions regarding the second patchset from Simon - 
is it going to be applied as is, or is a new revision required?

If it is going to be applied, shall I rebase my remaining patches on top 
of it or would you prefer Simon to rebase his patches (I think, he has 
only one patch, touching tmio: [PATCH 1/4])? As for the rest of the 
patches, IIRC, the only remaining issue, that I'll be fixing today is 
Magnus' wish to allocate the bounce buffer dynamically. Although, I could 
imagine doing that incrementally, because the #ifdef, that Magnus would 
like to get rid of is already now in the code, it is not introduced by 
these my patches. But I can redo my patches too, no problem.

What would be the preferred approach?

Thanks
Guennadi
