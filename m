To quantify things, for shmobile I am currently aware of 4 problems that
seem to be worthy of fixing for v3.10. A patche for one has been
accepted into arm-soc, Patches for two are this pull request. And one more
has a patch in the pipeline.

These known problems seem to fall into two categories:

1. Problems that have been in linux-next for a while but only recently
   appeared in the renesas tree. These were observed when boot testing kernels
   during the course of rebasing the renesas tree on v3.10-rcX.

   I believe that these problems could and should have been
   spotted earlier by boot testing linux-next more often,
   allowing them to be resolved in the merge-window rather than
   at -rc time.

   I intend to make this happen.

2. Problems that have been present in the renesas tree and
   thus linux-next for a while but were not observed as
   early as they might have been.

   Statistically the rate of these problems could have
   been reduced by accepting changes more slowly.
   But at this point we are talking about one or two bugs out
   of many many changes. Bugs that only affect a small
   subset of shmobile hardware support.
