Hi Sergei,

Thanks for this patch, good to see that the relationship between the
USB Host and the PHY is described via DT.

This patch seems to cover USB0 and USB2 that both require special
control in the PHY. How about USB1? Can you explain about the reason
why you omit that?

I somehow expected USB1 to be tied to the PHY via DT as well, this so
the PHY driver can be able to disable the hardware if no ports are
registered. In detail, I'm thinking that the register.bit
UGCTL.CONNECT wants to be set to 0 by default but be set to 1 once one
or more USB controllers are hooked up to the PHY.

Cheers,

/ magnus
