I don't agree with you. The generic compatible strings should express 
compatibility with a hardware interface to the system, not compatibility with 
particular drivers on particular operating systems. We can thus have generic 
compatible strings without taking the OS into account.

That would also be possible, but I believe that patch 1/2 is still the right 
thing to do, in which case patch 2/2 is required anyway.
