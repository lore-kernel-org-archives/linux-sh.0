Alright, now my AR6002-based card is working with your patches. At
least it seems to be working - my antenna cable is broken so I can
unfortunately not do any more proper than a simple "iwlist wlan0
scan". Good thing is that the SDIO IRQ mode and polling mode seem to
behave about the same.

Please note that I did not test using the upstream driver. I couldn't
get that one working last week, so today I reverted to using my last
known working configuration - the out-of-tree "ar69_sdk" driver
pointed out by the following instructions:
http://armin762.wordpress.com/2010/05/24/nvidia-tegra2-getting-wifiatheros-=
6002-working/

Anyway, I'm all for including your SDIO IRQ patches, but I think that
they should be reworked a bit.

I propose using two flags:

1) A hardware-has-sdio-irq-support flag for include/linux/mfd/tmio.h,
perhaps TMIO_MMC_SDIO_IRQ

The SDIO IRQ hardware registers are only touched when tmio-mmc is
provided the TMIO_MMC_SDIO_IRQ flag. The default behavior would be to
mask the SDIO IRQ interrupt source regardless of the MMC_CAP_SDIO_IRQ
flag. This should allow us to always enable the SDIO IRQ interrupt
source in INTC. The SDIO driver should set the TMIO_MMC_SDIO_IRQ flag
to show that SDHI is known to support SDIO IRQ.

Hopefully this TMIO_MMC_SDIO_IRQ flag will make it easier for Ian to
review the code and see that it doesn't break any other platforms that
may or may not lack SDIO IRQ support.

2) The regular MMC_CAP_SDIO_IRQ flag.

This is enabled per board. If the SDIO IRQ feature doesn't work in
some case then the system integrator can simply just simply go back to
polled mode by not setting MMC_CAP_SIDO_IRQ.

I'm not sure if we can keep the SDIO IRQ interrupt source constantly
enabled in INTC though. Your current patches require the board
specific MMC_CAP_SDIO_IRQ flag to be paired with the cpu-specific INTC
enable change. If someone wishes tho disable SDIO_IRQ support for
their board then they must know that they also need to revert the INTC
enable bits, otherwise they'll get endless interrupts when the
tmio-mmc driver starts. I believe the two-flag approach above will
solve this problem.

Thanks,
