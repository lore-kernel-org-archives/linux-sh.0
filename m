So if we stick with the notion of the algrithm ID everything is settled now.

I will prepare a v6 that I will post as the whole patchset and an
additional incremental patch 1/3 from v3 to v6 for Paul's repo. Then
we can see if the SCBRR thing needs further discussion and if the rest
of the patchset is final.

Thanks to you all,

 Bastian
