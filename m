Yet if you look at the code path before my patches you'll see that IRQs 
were enabled only after cpuidle_idle_call() had returned success.

Yet this is discutable. Given that some hardware do have IRQs turned on 
upon exiting idle mode, I think we should generalize it so that 
the explicit enabling 
of IRQs, when needed, should be done as close as possible to the 
operation that caused idle mode to be entered.

According to Peter it is not.

Since it returned from default_idle() then IRQs are enabled.

Again, it does.

And that consolidation was a mistake IMHO.  We should assume that the 
exiting of idle mode has IRQs enabled already, and do so manually in the 
backend driver if it is not the case on particular hardware.  That's the 
only way to ensure uniformity at a higher level.

Yet, if a code path is buggy in that regard, whether this is through 
cpuidle when enabled, or the default idle function otherwise, then the 
warning is there in cpu_idle_loop() to catch them all.

Again this is redundant.
