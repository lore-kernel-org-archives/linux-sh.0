Subject: [PATCH v2 0/7] ARM: shmobile: koelsch reference: Enable DMA for QSPI

This patch series enables DMA support for QSPI on r8a7791/koelsch
reference.  It's independent from the series "ARM: shmobile: koelsch
legacy: Enable DMA for QSPI", but it depends on the SHDMA work for r8a7790
by Ben Dooks (cfr. "[PATCH v2 0/9] Updates Renesas OF-DMA code").

Changes Compared to previous submission ("[PATCH/RFC 0/7] ARM: shmobile:
r8a7791: Add preliminary DMA support"):
  - "[6/7] ARM: shmobile: r8a7791 dtsi: Enable DMA for MSIOF" was dropped,
  - 2/7 was added,
  - 7/7 was changed (see changelog in individual patch).

This was tested on r8a7791/koelsch.

Performance figures for reading from a QSPI FLASH driven at 24.375 MHz are:
  - Single:  1.1 Mbps PIO, 23 Mbps DMA
  - Dual  : 12.7 Mbps PIO, 48 Mbps DMA
  - Quad  : 13   Mbps PIO, 70 Mbps DMA

Thanks for your comments!

when I'm talking to journalists I just say "programmer" or something like that.
