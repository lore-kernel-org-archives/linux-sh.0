I think that patch landed as commit 78c5e0bb145d. But for some unknown
reason it didn't remove all selects statements for ARCH_HAS_OPP.

The odd thing here is that the last select statements I remove in this
patch are all to be found in Kconfig files that actually were touched in
that commit. Perhaps these select statements were merged back in during
conflict resolution. I have no idea.
