The clock can be controlled through e.g. pm_clk domain (pm_clk_notifier
and pm_clk_{suspend,resume}()) or genpd (GENPD_FLAG_PM_CLK,
which you have added yourself ;-)

When a child is to be runtime-resumed, the core make sure the parent is
runtime-resumed. When all children have been runtime-suspended, the parent
is runtime-suspended. This is already working. This patch series is the
only missing piece: without a driver that calls pm_runtime_enable(), the
parent is not runtime-managed.

Thanks!
