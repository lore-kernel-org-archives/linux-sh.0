I've been passively monitoring these patches as they were going by on
l-k, so there aren't really any surprises here. We'll need to do a bit of
refactoring to start using it once it is merged, but that shouldn't be
too problematic.

Right now we're using a shared clock framework between sh and ARM-based
SH-Mobile CPUs (drivers/sh/clk.c and include/linux/sh_clk.h), so both
should convert fairly easily at the same time.

It also doesn't seem like this really poses any problems or overlap with
Jean-Christophe's work for making the clkdev bits generic, so we should
be able to do both independently. If you haven't seen that, it's
currently pending in the ARM patch tracker:
