Do you really want the oprofile name scheme move to perf?

Or, do you mean here to derive an oprofile name from the pmu string in
a generic way? I was suggesting this for SH when commenting on version
3 of this patch set. We dropped this idea to keep changes simple for
this initial patch set, because it was much easier to implement it
with strcmp() and the pmu strings are not expected to be changed for
sh in the near future.

So, can't we use op_name_from_perf_name() from [PATCH -v3 6/6] for SH
here and implement a perf_pmu_name() function for sh that is part of
perf's generic interface? 

Later we can add a generic function for sh ...

... and also other architectures on top of these patches.
