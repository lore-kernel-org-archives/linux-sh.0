I'm in favor of removing sh5 (64-bit). It's already been removed from
GCC and as I understand there was never any hardware really available.
There's also a lot of NUMA-type infrastructure in arch/sh that looks
like YAGNI violations -- no clear indication that there is or ever was
any hardware it made sense on. That could probably be removed too.

My intent here was always, after getting device tree theoretically
working for some reasonable subset of socs/boards, drop the rest and
add them back as dts files (possibly plus some small drivers) only if
there's demand/complaint about regression.
