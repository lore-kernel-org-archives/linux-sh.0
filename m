I can reproduce the error with the following output:
/tmp/ccYAbker.s: Assembler messages:
/tmp/ccYAbker.s: Error: bad immediate value for 8-bit offset (2048)
make[3]: *** [drivers/mtd/nand/docg4.o] Error 1

The compiler version is: gcc version 4.6.3 (Ubuntu/Linaro 4.6.3-1ubuntu5)
I usually use: gcc version 4.4.1 (Sourcery G++ Lite 2010q1-202) and
can compile things without problems.

I found some old bug reports (from 2005) on the same issue with arm gcc.

Do we want to send a bug report? I've read in the gnu gcc docs about
reporting and they want the minimal set of data to reproduce this bug.
Hmmmm....

The command line used (with --save-temps added as they want it) is:
arm-linux-gnueabi-gcc -Wp,-MD,drivers/mtd/nand/.docg4.o.d  -nostdinc
-isystem /usr/lib/gcc/arm-linux-gnueabi/4.6/include
-I$KERNEL_DIR/arch/arm/include -Iarch/arm/include/generated  -Iinclude

-D"KBUILD_MODNAME=3DKBUILD_STR(docg4)" --save-temps -c -o
drivers/mtd/nand/docg4.o drivers/mtd/nand/docg4.c

This generates docg4.i.

The only way for them to reproduce it would be getting the kernel as a
whole with the .config, no?

cheers,

 Bastian
