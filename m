Hi Olof, Hi Arnd,

please consider the following SoC fixes for 3.8.
Its a little embarrassing, but they all fix problems introduced
in previous pull-requests for 3.8 that have been merged.

* The three Revert patches back-out secondary CPU initialisation
  changes from Bastian Hecht which he as advised me are incorrect
  and break secondary CPU initialisation.

* The clkfwk patch from Morimoto-san resolves a build warning.

This pull-request is based on the renesas/soc3 branch in the arm-soc tree.
