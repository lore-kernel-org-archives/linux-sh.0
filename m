Ok, that sounds fine.

I wonder if this is something you can use/adapt clk_rate_round_helper()
for? In any event, the best place for this is in drivers/sh/clk/core.c
along with the other helpers. The ranged div iterator already takes the
parent frequency in to account, so you might be able to use a similar
approach for an iterator here, too (albeit probably inverted). If you
introduce a generic clk_rate_parent_round() or whatever then that's
pretty easy to support without any of the nasty layering violations.

I don't like having this sort of knowledge in the platform code because
there is really nothing platform specific about it. If a platform happens
to be the first to exhibit a certain type of clock topology interactivity,
then that's something the clock framework needs to expand to accomodate.
Most of these things will invariably show up on other platforms in the
future, and by then the same algorithm will have been copied all over the
place, mangled, and probably broken in a dozen different hard to debug
ways. Keeping all of the rounders centrally managed will help prevent
this, regardless of what sort of obscure topology perversion the hardware
folks come up with :-)
