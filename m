Not really in this patch, but Linus recently added the 'groups'
property. Somewhere in this thread he explained how he'd like to see
things used. With mux nodes that contain 'groups' and 'function' and
conf nodes that can contain 'groups' or 'pins' and the pinconf options.
And pins/groups would actually refer to only pins or groups
respectively.

Also, I hope all my changes here don't break the current behavior. So,
those 27 driver should still be able to do what they currently do. But I
hope they could migrated over to use the generic bindings only in the
longer term, so that these custom properties disappear.

Why would you still need those? I think the idea is to get rid of custom
pins, groups and function properties. Could you explain why those are
needed and why that couldn't be migrated to the amended bindings as outlined by
Linus, please?
