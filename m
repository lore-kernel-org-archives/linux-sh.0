Can do that, yes.

So far TMIO_MMC_HAS_IDLE_WAIT is set on

board-kzm9g.c (sh73a0 / AG5)
board-ag5evm.c (sh73a0 / AG5)
board-armadillo800eva.c (r8a7740 / A1)
board-kota2.c (sh73a0 / AG5)
board-marzen.c (r8a7779 / H1)

and isn't set on

board-ap4evb.c (sh7372 / ap4)
board-bonito.c (r8a7740 / a1, SDHI isn't used)
board-mackerel.c (sh7372 / ap4)

So, shall we use a compatible property for this and drop this property? We 
can add later at any time, if needed, which is better, than defining 
something redundant. OTOH I seem to remember, that using SoC-version from 
the "compatible" property was considered by someone inappropriate. Magnus, 
what do you think?

So, if we drop TMIO_MMC_BLKSZ_2BYTES and TMIO_MMC_HAS_IDLE_WAIT, we only 
keep toshiba,mmc-wrprotect-disable to set TMIO_MMC_WRPROTECT_DISABLE? And 
that one is definitely needed, because that even differs between SDHI 
instances on one SoC.
