In general Renesas hardware is not documented to the extent
where the relationship between IP blocks on different SoCs can be assumed
although they may appear to operate the same way. Furthermore the
documentation typically does not specify a version for individual
IP blocks. For these reasons a convention of using the SoC name in place
of a version and providing SoC-specific compat strings has been adopted.

Although not universally liked this convention is used in the bindings
for the drivers a number of drivers for Renesas hardware. The purpose
of this patch is to update the Renesas R-Car Compare Match Timer (CMT)
driver to follow this convention.

* I plan to follow up with patches to use these new bindings in the
  dtsi files for the affected SoCs.
