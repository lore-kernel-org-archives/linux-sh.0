Thanks. This hack worked. Although curiously while I see keyboard
events for pins 1 - 3 I don't get any for pin 4. Perhaps there is
a hardware fault on my board.

I'm unsure of what the best way forward is. It seems that
the nicest option would be to add PFC support for KZM9D.
But is that likely to happen?

If not, I think your last suggestion would be best.
Though I'm not quite sure that I understand the implementation implications.
