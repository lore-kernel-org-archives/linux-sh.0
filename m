I was thinking of the reverse: drop "simple-bus" bus from the list here,
but not add "simple-pm-bus" to of_default_bus_match_table. This will
cause child devices to no longer be probed automatically, and you will
have to call of_platform_populate() from simple_pm_bus_probe(), after
pm_runtime_enable(). This seems like a cleaner model to me, for two
reasons:

- In the binding, claiming compatibility with "simple-bus" feels
  wrong to me, because you have a bus that is not as simple as others

- The ordering between pm_runtime_enable() and the probing of the
  child devices is guaranteed, which I think it is not with your
  current code.

Does this make sense, or am I missing an important reason why there
has to be a "simple-bus" compatible string here?
