Yes, I expect so.

The purpose of my patch was mainly to illustrate the problem
rather than to provide a diffinitive fix..

It appears to work :)

Awesome!

Yes :)


I wonder if the following is any good.

[PATCH] ARM: shmobile: Set clock frequency in HZ from OF nodes

shmobile_init_delay() looks for OF "clock-frequency" to determine
the delay which is set by calling shmobile_setup_delay().

Unfortunately this seems to be incorrect in detail as
"clock-frequency" node values are in HZ whereas the frequency
argument to shmobile_setup_delay() is in MHz.

Provide a variant of shmobile_setup_delay() that accepts HZ to
correct this problem.

v2
* As suggested by Geert Uytterhoeven
  - Don't ignore the potential for integer overflow.
    To this end I have taken Geert's suggestion of dividing by
    a large "value" in the HZ case.
    And I have let the original function unchanged for the MHz case:
    it should eventually be removed anyway.
