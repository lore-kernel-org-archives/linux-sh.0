Subject: [PATCH 0/3] sh-pfc: Don't include mach/*.h headers were not required

Hello,

The (long) road to multiplatform kernels requires getting rid of mach/*.h
headers in device drivers. This patch set removes some of the included mach
headers from the sh-pfc driver. The only remaining one is mach/irqs.h, to get
the irq_pin() macro. This will require more work, see [1] for a discussion of
the issue.

The patches are based on v3.11-rc2. Linus, do you usually pick pinctrl patches
from the list, or should I send you a pull request ?
