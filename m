The hardware block has two register ranges.
The first one handles boot mode and power management,
the second handles reset control and allows to read the mode strap pins.

The PM domain driver uses the first range, the reset handler uses the second
range.

I tried using syscon and syscon-reboot, but that needs some changes to the
syscon framework, as it currently provides access to the first register
range only. Providing access to the second region requires either:

  1. Extending the regmap to cover all ranges.
     Does regmap support multiple ranges? It seems regmap_range_cfg handles
     only virtual ranges (switchable by writing to a register), not
     always-mapped discontiguous ranges?

  2. Providing multiple regmaps, one for each register range.
     This needs modifications to look up ranges using a phandle and an
     (optional for backwards compatibility) index, and updates to drivers
     and bindings.

Am I missing an option?

Yes, sysc_base2 is used for reset control only (I don't think we need to read
the mode strap pins).

So unless there's a simple solution to the regmap problem, I think moving
this driver part to  drivers/power/reset is the most viable option.

Anyway, thanks for the syscon hint! I think it'll be useful for reset on
R-Car Gen2.
