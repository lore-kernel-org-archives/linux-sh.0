Please consider adding the dts file in a separate patch next time.

Thanks, I have queued this up in the boards3 branch.
It should make it into v3.13 but if not I'll rename the branch
soc after rebasing it on v3.13-rcX which will then be targeted at v3.14.

The boards3 branch includes boards code previously queued up for v3.13
and a merge with soc changes previously queued up for v3.13. The reason
for the merge is to provide various build and run-time dependencies
including the r7s72100 SoC code which this board code uses.
