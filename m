Guennadi, thanks a lot for this list of outstanding patches. I've
tested most of them myself and I think they are all a welcome addition
to the SDHI hardware block on SH-Mobile / R-Mobile SoCs. I'm not sure
how they affect other platforms though.

Ian, would it be possible for you to give some feedback? I know it's
holiday season and all, but the first version of most patches were
posted about a month ago.

If we can't get any feedback then perhaps someone else can maintain
the tmio-mmc driver together with Ian? Or maybe it's easier to just
easier to create a SDHI specific fork of the tmio-mmc driver which can
be modified more easily.

Any ideas?

Thanks,
