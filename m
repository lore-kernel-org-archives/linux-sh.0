Ah, sorry about that. I had stumbled over the persistent_clock
issue earlier and was confusing the two.

Well, the point is that has_persistent_clock() returns false because
it is not yet active when the flag gets set in timekeeping_init(),
but when we call read_persistent_clock() in timekeeping_suspend(),
it will actually return a non-zero time.

Ok.
