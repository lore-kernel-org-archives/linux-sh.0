I think, this depends on our interpretation of what struct dma_chan 
represents and who has control over it. If we think, that this is a 
purely software object, which at allocation time has absolutely no 
hardware association attached to it, then yes, only the dmaengine core 
should manage them at least at that time. If, however, we define, that 
struct dma_chan _can_ get hardware association already at allocation time 
in the context of DMAC's .alloc_chan_resources() function, then it's 
the DMAC that has to manage them.

And, I think, there is one important aspect to this, that tells us, that 
those channels cannot be absolutely hardware-agnostic: they are attached 
to DMAC instances. So, they intrinsically have some hardware association.

So, you have to take into account hardware limitations already at 
allocation time. You can do this by either asking the DMAC, whether a 
certain allocation can be performed (what we currently do with filters, 
and what this patch proposed to do with the multiplexer callback), or you 
can require some static information from DMACs, like a mapping that you 
propose.

Currently both approaches seem possible, however, a static mapping seems 
less flexible to me, I don't know whether it can describe all available 
hardware configurations. We shouldn't forget, that those mappings can be 
many-to-many, as in the sh-dma example. On sh-dma it would suffice and be 
optimal enough to have a pointer to a slave list in struct dma_chan. Would 
this also suit everyone else? Is this what you're thinking about?

Thanks
