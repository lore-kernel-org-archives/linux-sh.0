Ok, good!

No, I didn't mean moving all the SDHI loader code into the CPU
specific place - just the mmc_loader() function.

Yes, that's maybe more realistic, I'm not sure. Please remember that
you probably want to select different GPIO pins for different SDHI
instances, so you also need to adjust the
sdhi_boot_enter()/sdhi_boot_cleanup() to receive SDHI_BASE as an
argument too if you go down that route.

Not through Kconfig. I think you should use Kconfig to enable the SDHI
loader, but you should be able to select the SDHI base address during
run-time. Similar to how we enable platform device drivers with
Kconfig but put the instance information in the platform device
resource and data outside the driver.

So for instance, on some board we may want to read a GPIO pin at boot
up time to select if we should boot from SDHI0 or SDHI1. I would like
the SDHI loader to be designed so we can have support for multiple
instances complied-in. Because of that I'd like to see the fixed
SDHI_BASE disappear from the header, and letting the mmc_loader()
function take the base address as an argument, or simply move the
mmc_loader() function out of the SDHI loader code to give CPU specific
and/or board specific code freedom to select which ever SDHI hardware
block instance(s) they want to load from.

Perhaps this would require some serious refactoring?
