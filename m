	Hi Linus, Alex, Laurent, Simon, Magnus,

This patch series moves the setup of the GPIO-PFC pin mapping for
Renesas PFC/GPIO combos from C code to DT, and does some cleanups.
The move to DT is needed to make the GPIO hogging mechanism work, cfr.
the discussion following "[PATCH] [RFC] gpio: Retry deferred GPIO
hogging on pin range change" (https://lkml.org/lkml/2015/6/16/455).

The series consists of 3 parts:
  a. Patches 1-3 add the missing "gpio-ranges" properties to the dtsi
     files for all affected SoCs,
  b. Patch 4 disables the C code to set up the mapping on DT platforms
     (it's still needed on SH or ARM-legacy),
  c. Patches 5-7 do a few more cleanups in the sh-pfc gpio code.

Dependencies:
  - This series applies against next-next-20150630.
  - Part a must go in first, to avoid regressions.
    In addition, it's a prerequisite for "ARM: shmobile: armadillo800eva
    dts: Add pinctrl and gpio-hog for lcdc0", which has been queued up
    already in Simon's dt-for-v4.3 branch. Perhaps it can still be
    reordered?
  - While I didn't notice any bad behavior by having part a only, part b
    should go in immediately after part a. Hence I think it's best if
    Simon can take this one, too.
  - Part c is independent (it doesn't touch the same code), so it can go
    in before or after the other parts, or in parallel.

Thanks for applying!

when I'm talking to journalists I just say "programmer" or something like that.
