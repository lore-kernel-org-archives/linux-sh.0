Both the call-sites you're replacing do the following before pwm_disable():

		pwm_config(pb->pwm, 0, pb->period);

While I agree that probably shouldn't be necessary, I think it's at
least worth mentioning that in the commit description just to make it
obvious that it was a deliberate change. Splitting that change into a
separate patch might be reasonable in order to keep refactoring and
functional changes separate, although perhaps it's not worth it.

There are also a couple unrelated whitespace changes thrown in here.
