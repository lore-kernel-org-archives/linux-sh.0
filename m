	Hi Simon, Magnus,

This patch series transitions the r8a73a4/ape6evm platform to support
multiplatform only:
  - Add CCF information to DT,
  - Disable legacy clock if CCF is used,
  - Add Bus State Controller node, and move the Ethernet node to it,
  - Remove ape6evm-reference,
  - Remove ape6evm-legacy and legacy support code.

This series is based on renesas-drivers-2015-01-19-v3.19-rc5.
It depends on renesas-devel-20150119-v3.19-rc5 (code-wise) and
clk-shmobile-for-3.20 (functionality-wise), for which I've sent a pull
request to Mike Turquette yesterday.

All of this was untested by me due to lack of hardware.
As Mike had previously acked the r8a73a4 CCF implementation, it's safe
to apply after testing.

Thanks!
