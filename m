Hi Kevin, Hi Olof, Hi Arnd,

please consider this third round of Renesas ARM based SoC board
updates for v3.12.

It is based on a merge of:

* renesas-boards2-for-v3.12
  ("Second Round of ARM based SoC board updates for v3.12")
  which you have previously pulled.

* renesas-boards-cleanup-for-v3.12
  ("ARM based SoC board cleanups updates for v3.12")
  which you have previously pulled.

* git://people.freedesktop.Org/~airlied/linux drm-rcar-for-v3.12
  Which is in turn based on v3.11-rc3.
  This was provided by Dave Airlie to provide dependencies
  for the Display Unit changes in this series.

I encountered a minor merge conflict when I merged this branch into
my own next branch. My resolution is available in the renesas-next-20130823
tag of my renesas tree.

I apologise that this and other pull requests that I will send today
are rather later in the cycle than I would like. This is primarily due
to a combination of my summer vacation and wanting to let the patches
sit in next for a while.


The following changes since commit 3ddace5bccc5094a1d135fe4a9e555ef1d40006c:

  Merge branch 'drm-rcar-for-v3.12' of git://people.freedesktop.Org/~airlied/linux into boards3 (2013-08-22 11:11:55 +0900)
