Unfortunately, this mapping (form 0x20) is required from driver
for historical reasons.
So, driver setting needs to care about it.
Please check DMA_CHANNEL macro for each setup-xxx.c
# but, it works without care about it (?)
# becase there are mirror register there (?), I'm not sure detail


Best regards
