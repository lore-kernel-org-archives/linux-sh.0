If Chris prefers they go through the architecture side then that's not a
problem either. I'll be doing at least 2 merges during the merge window,
and this stuff is just adding in platform data, so it doesn't really
matter when it gets rolled in. Optionally if the MMC tree doesn't rebase
I can just set up a topic branch that branches off of that, roll these
patches on top of that, and you can just test that directly.
