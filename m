    Forgot to note that using PHY IRQ on Lager/Koelsch seems quite pointless 
to me as we're using ETH_LINK signal on these boards and Ether core generates 
interrupts on the change of this signal using which the driver actually 
controls packet Rx/Tx; Micrel PHY driver also only enables interrupts on link 
up/down -- so it seems only useful on BOCK-W where we ignore ETH_LINK and so 
the driver controls packet Rx/Tx from the phylib's adjust_link() callback.
