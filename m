Hm, but ideally we want something standard. How do you know the nonstd
flag is working as you expect from user space? All of a sudden you
have code that depends on what type of fbdev driver you are using.
This is ugly, but abstracting the nonstd interface does not make it
better IMO.

The nonstd thing is a hack, but for now it is close enough. V4L2 has
standard NV12/NV16 support already, but I don't think there is any
such thing for fbdev. So i see your patches as a stop-gap, but I
really don't want to make it more complicated than it has to be. So
exporting nonstd values in a header file to user space seems too
complicated IMO.

Please just live with the fact that nonstd is special for now. We need
to rework the entire LCDC/HDMI/DSI area to support multiple planes and
better PM anyway. Perhaps KMS is the way forward, or perhaps Media
Controller? Maybe both?

Please ditch the SH_FB_YUV constant all together. No need to build
some abstraction on top of a hackish interface. Just check if nonstd
is non-zero in the driver and assume that means YUV for now. That's
good enough.

Thanks,
