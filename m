I could create patches to add an optional "pci-domain" property for the R-Car
PCI drivers, and just attempt to get the property in the drivers. If not found,
the drivers will assume the domain is 0.

We would then have fixed PCI domain numbering and I don't have to worry about
Liviu's work.

Would that be ok?
 
Thanks
