    Yes, I have written the new driver for the generic PHY framework, 
supporting DT probing. I'm going to post it today -- I lacked the time to post 
all at once.
    This new driver (and some additional patches) provides for doing what 
you've indicated to be the desirable behavior, i.e. configuring the PHY's 
UGCTRL2 register depending on what kind of USB driver gets loaded. I hope you 
will be able to use my patches for your further work on USB DT support.
