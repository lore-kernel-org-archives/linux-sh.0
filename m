	Hi,

This patch series adds support to the Renesas SCI serial driver for
  - the optional external clock on (H)SCI(F) and some SCIFA, where this
    pin can serve as a clock input,
  - the optional clock sources for the Baud Rate Generator for External
    Clock (BRG), as found on some SCIF variants and on HSCIF.
Using external clocks increases the range and accuracy of supported baud
rates. Please see the descriptions of the DTS patches for more detailed
information regarding the impact on the supported platforms.

For now this supports r8a7791/koelsch and r8a7795/salvator-x only, which
have an external SCIF_CLK running at 14.7456 MHz.
Support for other R-Car platforms will be added later.

Testing:
  - The Baud Rate Generator for External Clock (BRG) was tested with
    SCIF and HSCIF on r8a7791/koelsch and r8a7795/salvator-x,
  - The external clock input on (H)SCK was tested on r8a7795/salvator-x
    by feeding an external clock signal to (H)SCIF1,
  - Various bit rates were monitored using a SmartScope,
  - Regression testing was done on Renesas ARM platforms that use SCIFA
    as the console (r8a73a4/ape6evm, r8a7740/armadillo, and
    sh73a0/kzm9g).
	      
Dependencies:
  - This series depends on the series "[PATCH v2 00/16] serial: sh-sci:
    Clock Cleanups",
  - The SH patch 25 depends on the "serial: sh-sci" patches in this
    series,
  - The DTS patches 21-24 can be applied independently, once the DT
    binding patches 1-2 are accepted,
  - r8a7791/r8a7795 has a runtime dependency on series "[PATCH 0/2]
    pinctrl: sh-pfc: r8a7791/r8a7795: Add SCIF_CLK support",
  - r8a7795 also depends on
       - platform support in e.g. renesas-drivers-2015-11-17-v4.4-rc1,
       - "[PATCH] pinctrl: sh-pfc: r8a7795: Add HSCIF pins, groups, and
	 functions",
       - "[PATCH] arm64: renesas: r8a7795 dtsi: Add all HSCIF nodes".
  - Legacy SH has a runtime dependency on:
      - series "[PATCH 0/2] drivers: sh: clk: Cleanup clock API",

Thanks for your comments!
