I like the idea, but have issues with implementations :-). 
 
It is supposed that additional parameters are not generic, 
otherwise they will be part of enum pin_config_param, right?

Probably it will be better if clients could pass array with
driver specific dt bindings to pinconf_generic_dt_node_to_map()?
