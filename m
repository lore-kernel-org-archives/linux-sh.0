This patch series makes kzm9d-reference to move to new clk implementation
 based on the common clock framework and device tree.

First three are for preparation.
[PATCH 1/6] clocksource: em_sti: convert to clk_prepare/unprepare
[PATCH 2/6] serial8250-em: convert to clk_prepare/unprepare
[PATCH 3/6] sh: clkfwk: Select sh-/common- clkfwk alternatively

Next one is a proposal document of DT bindings.
[PATCH 4/6] ARM: shmobile: emev2: Define SMU clock DT bindings

This is the implementation, and dts which carries clock tree description.
[PATCH 5/6] clk: emev2: Add support for emev2 SMU clocks with DT

Last one is small modification needed for migration.
[PATCH 6/6] ARM: shmobile: kzm9d-reference: Use common clock

These patches do not remove sh-clkfwk version, even on emev2.
kzm9d(without -reference) target still uses sh-clkfwk.
I believe this method encourages step-by-step migration on other sh-mobile
 targets, too.

Patches should be applied and compiled both on
 v3.12-rc2 and
 kernel/git/horms/renesas.git tag:renesas-devel-20130922 

Confirmed on kernel/git/horms/renesas.git tag:renesas-devel-20130922 
for boot up to command prompt.
- kzm9d board / multiplatform + kzm9d-reference configuration
- kzm9d board / kzm9d-reference configuration
- kzm9d board / kzm9d (with sh-clkfwk) configuration for regression.
- ape6evm (with sh-clkfwk) for regression.
for compile only
- sh7757lcr (in arch/sh with sh-clkfwk) for regression.
