Let me remind people that clkdev is *NOT* part of clk, and that I'm the
maintainer for clkdev.

I'm getting rather pissed off with people taking work away from me, even
when I'm named in the MAINTAINERS file.  These patches are going through
my tree unless there's a good reason for them not to.  They are _not_
going through the clk tree.
