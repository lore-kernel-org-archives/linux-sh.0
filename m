It was actually four days ago:

That way you get unions of mutexes and spinlocks (which is one thing
we're trying to avoid) and conditionals controlling whether a mutex
or spinlock is taken - which we've already ascertained was strongly
objected to by folk in mainline (and quite rightfully so IMHO.)

I'm saying keep all the options open until we've got the whole thing
sorted out.  If you think it's possible to do without creating a mess
in the process - and without unions of mutexes and spinlocks or
conditionals controlling whether we use mutex_lock vs spin_lock then
please show the patches.
