Thanks, I think the above text should have been:

* Set .control_parent for all irqpin instances for sh73a0 SoC when
  booting using legacy C

  This fixes a long standing problem which has been present since
  the sh73a0 SoC started using the INTC External IRQ pin driver.

  The patch that introduced the problem is 341eb5465f67437a ("ARM:
  shmobile: INTC External IRQ pin driver on sh73a0") which was included
  in v3.10.

* ARM: shmobile: r8a7740: Instantiate GIC from C board code in legacy builds

  This fixes a regression in the r8a7740 SoC due to
  9a1091ef0017c40a ("irqchip: gic: Support hierarchy irq domain.")
  which was included in v3.18-rc2.
