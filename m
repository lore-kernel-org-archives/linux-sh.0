    Oh yes, it does: phylib fails to recognize link down/up after you 
disconnect/reconnect the cable since it relies solely on IRQ for the link 
changes if it's specified.
    Now for the really good news: I was able to get the PHY IRQs on Koelsch 
board when I set the trigger mode to falling-edge; that seemed strange as the 
PHY interrupts are level-sensitive, according to the documentation. And only 
after we commented out the wild PHY reset done by the 'sh_eth' driver on each 
open, I was able to get the IRQs in the low-level trigger mode.
    So, I'm expecting to be able to finally resolve this issue on top of the 
net-next tree which now contains 2 patchsets that should enable me to finally 
remove that wild PHY reset for good:
