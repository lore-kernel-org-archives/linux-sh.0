The thing here is that arch/sh is way behind on the API use, and it
has prevented us from cleaning up drivers as well. A slave driver
should have to just call dma_request_chan() with a constant
string to identify its channel rather than going two different ways
depending on whether it's used with DT or platform data.

If you hack on it, please convert the dmaengine platform data to use
a dma_slave_map array to pass the data into the dmaengine driver,
mapping the settings from a (pdev-name, channel-id) tuple to a pointer
that describes the channel configuration rather than having the
mapping from an numerical slave_id to a struct sh_dmae_slave_config
in the setup files. It should be a fairly mechanical conversion.

The other part I noticed is arch/sh/drivers/dma/*, which appears to
be entirely unused, and should probably removed.
