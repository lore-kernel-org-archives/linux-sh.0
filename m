links to the USB PHY device.

This patch is against 'renesas-devel-20140924-v3.17-rc6' tag of Simon Horman's
'renesas.git' repo plus R8A7791/Koelsch/Henninger USB PHY support patches posted
before.  The patch requires the USB PHY driver and USB HCD generic PHY support
(merged by Kishon and Greg recently) in order to work.

Changes in version 4:
- refreshed the patch.

Changes in version 3:
- adjusted "phys" properties in the PCI OHCI/EHCI device nodes;
- resolved rejects.

Changes in version 2:
- renamed the PCI OHCI/EHCI device nodes to comply with the PCI binding;
- changed the PHY specifier in the PCI#1 node to reflect that channel #1 support
  was dropped;
- resolved rejects.
