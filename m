If drivers could have a field to say that they allow the driver-core
or the pm-runtime would mean that drivers could easily be change without
having to deal with what the SoC/SoC family have to care about this.

It would also mean that we could change drivers without having to make
any changes to the SoC to say that it has to opt-in to the support.
