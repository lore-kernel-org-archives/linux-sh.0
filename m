I have now had a chance to re-examine these patches and it seems to me that
they do not depend on the BSC driver (or anything else other than for
context). With that in mind I have queued them up in the
sh73a0-multiplatform-for-v3.21 which is based on the dt-for-v3.21 branch
(for context) as part of and pushed this as part of
renesas-devel-20150123-v3.19-rc5.

Please take a moment to see if what I have done makes sense to you.

For reference this covers the following patches which comprised this series:

Magnus Damm (4):
  ARM: shmobile: sh73a0: Introduce generic setup callback
  ARM: shmobile: sh73a0: Add Multiplatform support
  ARM: shmobile: kzm9g dts: Sync with kzm9g-reference dts
  ARM: shmobile: kzm9g: Build DTS for Multiplatform
