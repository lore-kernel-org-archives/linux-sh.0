I would assume you did, or you happened to never actually use

Ah, right. The mask is a problem because PCI devices assume that
they can do DMA to any 32-bit masked address without calling
dma_set_mask. Your trick to describe the system memory at a different
physical alias would solve this part. Another option might be to
add a quirk in the OHCI/EHCI drivers, if you are able to detect
this special case from the PCI IDs. Whether we can allow the PCI host
controller to just set a mask is an open question. If we decide to go
that route, you should be able to do it using the add_bus() callback
in the host controller driver. However, it would be a departure from
the normal way of doing PCI DMA, and I can't foresee what the implications
would be.
