I agree with you, the decision has made itself to use allocation routines that 
will not sleep. However,

$ grep -r GFP_NOWAIT drivers/dma | wc -l
22
$ grep -r GFP_ATOMIC drivers/dma | wc -l
24

Looks like a draw to me :-) I'm pretty sure most of the decisions to use 
GFP_NOWAIT or GFP_ATOMIC are cases of cargo-cult programming instead of 
resulting from a thoughtful process. We should document this in Maxime's new 
DMA engine internals documentation.

This being said, I wonder whether allowing the prep functions to be called in 
atomic context was a sane decision. We've pushed the whole DMA engine API to 
atomic context, leading to such niceties as memory allocation pressure and the 
impossibility to implement runtime PM support without resorting to a work 
queue for the sole purpose of power management, in *every* DMA engine driver. 
I can't help but thinking something is broken.

I'd like your opinion on that. Whether fixing it would be worth the effort is 
a different question, so we could certainly conclude that we'll have to live 
with an imperfect design for the time being.

That's an easy enough implementation, but given that channels are usually 
requested at probe time and released at remove time, that would be roughly 
equivalent to no PM at all.

If I'm not mistaken, the DMA engine API doesn't provide a way to synchronously 
start DMA transfers. An implementation could do so, but no guarantee is 
offered by the API to the caller. I agree, however, that it could be an issue.

Doesn't this call for a new pair of open/close-like functions in the API ? 
They would be called right before a client driver starts using a channel, and 
right after it stops using it. Those functions would be allowed to sleep.

Beside simplifying power management, those functions could also be used for 
lazy hardware channel allocation. Renesas SoCs have DMA engines that include 
general-purpose channels, usable by any slave. There are more slaves than 
hardware channels, so not all slaves can be used at the same time. At the 
moment the hardware channel is allocated when requesting the DMA engine 
channel, at probe time for most slave drivers. This breaks when too many 
slaves get registered, even if they're not all used at the same time. Some 
kind of lazy/delayed allocation scheme would be useful.

Another option would be to request the DMA engine channel later than probe 
time, when the channel will actually be used. However, that would break 
deferred probing, and would possibly degrade performances.

That's why I liked the ability to sleep in the prep functions ;-)

Nice. That pretty much bans the usage of a workqueue then, we need something 
else.
