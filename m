Unfortunately not. Unlike for the YCbCr visual, I don't see a field we
can easily
(ab)use for that. Except if it's limited to standard 16-235/240 Y vs.
full 0-255 Y,
for which we could just have 2 different visual types.

Good question!

I'm still puzzled about this KMS thing. If the name "Kernel Mode Setting"
covers it, then how does it compare to plain fbdev? Just additional frame buffer
memory management?

Furthermore, everybody states that "future X/desktop" will require KMS drivers.
How do/will we handle this on dumb frame buffers? It's not like we can't do
"advanced" things like compositing using the CPU. Transparency may stretch
it a bit on lower end CPUs, but you don't always need that.
