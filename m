Subject: [PATCH/RFC v2 4/4] ARM: shmobile: r8a7740 dtsi: Add minimal device node for Coresight-ETM

If power area D4, which contains the Coresight-ETM hardware block, is
powered down on R-Mobile A1 (r8a7740), the kernel crashes when
suspending from s2ram with:

    Internal error: Oops - undefined instruction: 0 [#1] ARM

This happens because dbg_cpu_pm_notify() calls reset_ctrl_regs(), which
can't access the debug registers as the debug module is powered down.

Add a minimal device node for the Coresight-ETM hardware block, and hook
it up to the D4 PM domain, so the R-Mobile System Controller driver can
keep the arm_dbg_regs_available flag in sync with the state of the D4 PM
domain.

This is a fix on top of series "[PATCH 00/13] ARM: shmobile: R-Mobile:
DT PM domain support" (https://lkml.org/lkml/2014/9/25/452), to be
folded into "[PATCH v3 10/13] ARM: shmobile: r8a7740 dtsi: Add PM domain
support" (https://lkml.org/lkml/2014/9/25/450).

v2:
  - New
