Hi Manuel,

Thanks for your email.

As for the SuperH Mobile LCDC block, the sh7723 is register compatible
with sh7722, but it only supports a single channel. I suspect that
sh7343 is register compatible with sh7722 as well, but I have no docs.
Both SYS and RGB interfaces are supported. Up to 24bpp. Both RGB and
YUV pixel formats are supported by the hardware. Clock configuration
and SYS bus stuff is shared between the channels.

The sh7760 LCDC supports a single channel using RGB interface up to
16bpp. No YUV. Just a handful of registers seem to have the same
layout as the SuperH Mobile LCDC block.

My gut feeling is that the complexity of a driver for one type of LCDC
block is enough. Think about the number of combinations of board type,
processor type, LCD panel, bus type, bus configuration and potentially
external LCD controller chip. And now we're talking about an extra
dimension on top of that... =)

If we can unify drivers and keep the complexity relatively low then
that's great, but before that can happen we sort of need something to
unify. So please write simple framebuffer drivers for now, and work on
getting them merged upstream. And when that's done _then_ we can unify
drivers and/or break out common code. In my mind, that's the right
order to do things.
