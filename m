This works a slightly different way for the Renesas SoCs, though.  The
mach-shmobile code is (almost) entirely specific to the SoCs and boards and
everything else is already under drivers/ and elsewhere.  That's because
much of that code is shared between the ARM and SH architectures (since there
are SH CPU core in many of those systems along with the ARM CPU cores).
So we generalize the common parts by putting them out of arch/arm rather
than by putting them into a common place in there.

Now, if you insist on us having a separate mach- directory for every platform
(SoC), we can do that I think, but then we should start with splitting up the
existing mach-shmobile into a number of SoC-specific directories rather than
adding new mach- directories for random new parts, because that goes against
our development history to date, which is important too IMHO.

Thanks,
Rafael
