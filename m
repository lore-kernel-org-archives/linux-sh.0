Subject: [PATCH v3 00/20] ARM: shmobile: r8a7779, marzen: CCF and multiplatform

The aim of this series is to add common clock framework and in turn
multiplatform support to the r8a7779 SoC and marzen-reference.  It
subsequently removes non-multiplatform support from marzen-reference.


This is based on work for R-Car Gen2 by Laurent Pinchart and Magnus Damm.


This series is based on the renesas-devel-v3.14-rc4-20140225
tag of my renesas tree.

This series is known not to work when
booting with SMP enabled and maxcpus not set to 0.
