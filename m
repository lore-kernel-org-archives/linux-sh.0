Renesas ARM Based SoC DT Updates for v4.2

* Enable DMA for HSUSB on r8a7790 and r8a7791 SoCs
* Configure the HOME key as wake-up source on kzm9g board
* Use generic names for device nodes on SH Mobile SoCs and boards
* Add "nor-jedec" compatible value to SH Mobile boards
* Add IRQC clock to r8a73a4, r8a779* SoCs
* Remove MSIOF address from r8a7790 and r8a7791 SoCs
