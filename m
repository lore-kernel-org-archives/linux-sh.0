And thank you for your comments.

Yes, I guess that using the nonstd together with the bits_per_pixel,
REN_COLOR_NV12 is unnecessary.

Sounds good.  By 20 bit are you referring to the YCbCr 4:4:4 mode?  I 
haven't really looked at that but it sounds like it should work.  I 
think that its a 24 bit mode though, if I understand correctly 8 bits 
each for Y, Cb, Cr.

I'm also looking at re-arranging the arrangement of the Y and CbCr 
planes so that in a double buffer (or more) situation all of the Y 
planes come first, followed by the CbCr planes, as it makes the panning 
calculations much simpler.

I'll submit these all as a version 2 of this patch.
