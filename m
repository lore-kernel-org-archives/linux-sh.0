Subject: [PATCH 2/3] ARM: shmobile: r8a7790: specify multiple parents for cpg_clks

The current drivers/clk/shmobile/clk-rcar-gen2.c uses the
extal_clk reference for the parent of all the clocks that
it registers. However the lb, qspi, sdh, sd0 and sd1 clocks
are all parented to either pll1 or pll1_div2 which means
that the clock rates are incorrect.

This is part of the fix that corrects the SDHI0 clock
rate error where it reports 1MHz instead of 97.5:
    sh_mobile_sdhi ee100000.sd: mmc0 base at 0xee100000 clock rate 1 MHz

Notes:
- May require cross-merge with clk-rcar-gen2.c fix
- Also not clear which clock "z" is to fix it.
