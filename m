DDI0471B_gic400_r0p1_trm.pdf says:

    Address range GIC-400 functional block
    A. 0x0000 - 0x0FFF Reserved
    B. 0x1000 - 0x1FFF Distributor
    C. 0x2000 - 0x3FFF CPU interfaces
    D. 0x4000 - 0x4FFF Virtual interface control block, for the processor that
                       is performing the access
    E. 0x5000 - 0x5FFF Virtual interface control block, for the processor
                       selected by address bits [11:9]
    F. 0x6000 - 0x7FFF Virtual CPU interfaces

The DT binding document says:
  1. The  first region is the GIC distributor register base and size.
  2. The 2nd region is the GIC cpu interface register base and size.
  3. The first additional region is the GIC virtual interface control register
     base and size.
  4. The 2nd additional region is the GIC virtual cpu interface register base
     and size.

Matching with the example:

        interrupt-controller@2c001000 {
                compatible = "arm,cortex-a15-gic";
                #interrupt-cells = <3>;
                interrupt-controller;
                reg = <0x2c001000 0x1000>,
                      <0x2c002000 0x1000>,
                      <0x2c004000 0x2000>,
                      <0x2c006000 0x2000>;
                interrupts = <1 9 0xf04>;
        };

This means:
  - reg entry 1. covers address range B,
  - reg entry 2. covers address range C,
  - reg entry 3. covers address ranges D _and_ E,
  - reg entry 4. covers address range F.

On R-Car Gen3, the base addresses are:

    Distributor             : 0xF101_0000
    CPU interfaces          : 0xF102_0000
    Virtual interfaces      : 0xF104_0000
    Virtual interfaces      : 0xF105_0000
    Virtual CPU interfaces  : 0xF106_0000

Note the additional multiplication factor of 16 in the offsets relative to
the base address 0xf1000000 (e.g. 0x50000 instead of 0x5000).

As address ranges D and E are merged in a single reg entry, how is the GIC
driver supposed to know about this multiplication factor?

Thanks!

Gr{oetje,eeting}s,
