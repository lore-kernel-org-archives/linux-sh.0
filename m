Most drivers have a single functional clock (if any) and only need it to be 
enabled/disabled in sync with runtime PM. As this requirements is common, 
making it the default sounds reasonable. Other drivers need to manage their 
clocks, or at least part of their clocks, manually. There are good and bad 
reasons for this, and some bad reasons come from driver code that should be 
fixed, but we can't ignore the problems for now.

The simplest implementation would be a way to let a driver opt-out completely. 
Unless a driver opts out, the runtime PM core will get the default clock for 
the device (with a NULL con ID) and manage it automatically. I'm not sure what 
to do when the runtime PM core fails to get the clock, as this can be caused 
by various problems or non-problems.

One particular problem that needs to be considered is deferred probing. An 
option would be to have all non-SoC devices opt-out from automatic clock 
management, but that will make the opt-out case the most common one. We also 
need to consider IP cores that can be present on-SoC or off-SoC in discrete 
chips.

The problem isn't as simple as it seems, and more advanced implementations 
that would allow listing clocks that should be managed automatically (or the 
other way around) would also add another level of complexity. The required 
information is platform-dependent, but we currently don't express it as such 
in DT.
