I don't think I have any acks, only review comments. I think the code
itself is pretty much ready to be merged and has been tested here with
the Lager board.

The big issue for us is that we /must/ boot with fdt, which means the
less fdt support that is in the kernel then the more patches we end up
carrying out of tree. This is why we have been pushing patches out to
try and get the support in.
