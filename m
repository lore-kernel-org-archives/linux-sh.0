Good to hear that!

BTW, I see this:

        freelist_size = 32
        cache_line_size() = 64

It seems like the value returned by cache_line_size() in
arch/arm64/include/asm/cache.h disagrees with L1_CACHE_SHIFT  = 7:

        static inline int cache_line_size(void)
        {
                u32 cwg = cache_type_cwg();
                return cwg ? 4 << cwg : L1_CACHE_BYTES;
        }

Making cache_line_size() always return L1_CACHE_BYTES doesn't help.

Gr{oetje,eeting}s,
