That's correct. It will be useless though, as DEBUG_LL can only be used on 
multiarch.

Given that the SCIF/SCIFA/SCIFB port operate similarly, I wonder whether it 
wouldn't make more sense to add a generic DEBUG_SHMOBILE_SCIF implementation 
instead. We could then have sub-options to select the exact SoC type and port 
number, and compute the base address from that.

Sure, no problem.
