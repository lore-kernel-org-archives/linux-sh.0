    Or is it MosChip now? Can't remember all their renames. :-)

    I should mention that the serial PCI device has both I/O port and memory 
BARs; it's the driver's choice to use the I/O ports.

    Sorry, I don't usually review large patches -- it's very time consuming 
(my review took 2+ hours and yet I haven't pointed out all issues).

    Thanks. :-)

    You're risking clashes even at the source level, not even at object file 
level...

    You're actually pass excess parameters, both the index and the pointer.

    Will you look into it then, or should I?

    It just looks strange. What you actually have is clearly a host-to-PCI 
bridge. Instead you have one "virtual" PCI bus consisting of only PCI-PCI 
bridge device, and the real PCIe bus hanging from the PCI-PCI bridge. Weird...

    I wonder what does MAC mean in the PCIe context...

    Ah, missed that, sorry.

    OK.

    ... and therefore not writing these bits to the PCI command (not control, 
sorry) register. Perhaps because of that PCI-PCI bridge remains inactive...

    Look at rcar_rmw32() again -- it doesn't really do that.

    OK, please fix those.

    The problem actually is that you need to remember both CPU and PCI 
addresses, so 'struct of_pci_range' looks more fitting here...

    Because it's the way PCI works. You have the built-in devices always 
present and seen on a PCI bus. :-)

    I think it's rather you who are wasting resources. ;-) Why not just fail 
the probe when you have no link?
