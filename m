The issue is not about whether it builds or not.  linux-next is an
integration tree.  It exists for several purposes, all centered around
gathering code aimed _solely_ at the next merge window.  Code which isn't
going into the 4.4 merge window should not be in linux-next at the moment.

linux-next exists not only to provide "final" build testing of queued code,
but also to flag up conflicts between git trees.

If code which is not for the next merge window is present in linux-next,
then linux-next can no longer do its job properly: it can no longer provide
a useful source of git conflict warnings.

When a git tree gets accepted into linux-next, Stephen replies with an
email indicating the terms on which the tree is present, which includes
this:

The last point is the relevant point here.
