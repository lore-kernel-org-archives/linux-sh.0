Subject: [PATCH] ARM: hw_breakpoint: Trap undef instruction exceptions on wake-up

If power area D4, which contains the Coresight-ETM hardware block, is
powered down on R-Mobile A1 (r8a7740), the kernel crashes when
suspending from s2ram with:

    Internal error: Oops - undefined instruction: 0 [#1] ARM

This happens because dbg_cpu_pm_notify() calls reset_ctrl_regs(), which
can't access the debug registers as the debug module is powered down.

Protect the call to reset_ctrl_regs() by an undefined instruction hook,
like was done in commit 0d352e3d006c9589 ("ARM: hw_breakpoint: trap
undef instruction exceptions in reset_ctrl_regs") for another caller.

Question: Do we need the same protection in dbg_reset_notify()?
          I can't trigger that case, as r8a7740 has only one CPU core.
