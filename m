Thanks, I think I have all the previous ones that where pushed to the
linux-sh list. If there's a git tree I could pull from that would make
our job easier.

We have got SDHI0 and SDHI2 working with device tree, but we're
currently seeing less than a megabyte a second when direcly dd-ing
blocks from the card. Is this a noted issue? We got ~11MiB without
DMA on the 3.4-ltsi series.

As a note, I will be away from the 20th December untill Janurary 6th
and it is likely the rest of the team here will be away from 21st.
