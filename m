Subject: [PATCH] ARM: shmobile: dts: koelsch: Fix flash partition label and size
Message-Id: <1416960805-15185-1-git-send-email-horms+renesas@verge.net.au>

Update the size and names of flash partitions to match the
expectations of the loader which are as follows:

"loader"---0x0000_0000-0x0008_0000 [loader program (readonly)]
"user"  ---0x0008_0000-0x0060_0000 [U-Boot + bootargs + dt + uImage (readonly)]
"flash" ---0x0060_0000-0x0400_0000 [filesystem and free (read/write)]

["user"'s assumed breakdown]
U-boot+ bootargs(0x0008_0000-0x0010_0000) 512KB
Device tree     (0x0010_0000-0x0014_0000) 256KB
uImage          (0x0014_0000-0x0060_0000) 4.75MB

This replaces a patch that I previously posted, "shmobile: koelsch: Fix
flash partition label and size in device tree", which has the same aim but
does so for an older version of the loader which to my knowledge is not
found in the wild.

I plan to post a similar patch for Lager if this one goes well.

I have been informed that the flash layout should also be the same
for Alt (which currently does not have flash in its dts file in mainline).

Based on the renesas-devel-20141125-v3.18-rc6 tag of my renesas tree.
