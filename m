I'm not sure if we actually _have_to_ register via the platform
device, or if it just happens to be like that today because no one has
bothered creating a better abstraction. It is a mystery to me that
both a platform device is used to select actual driver, and then DT is
used to provide frequency and voltage information.

The cpufreq software policy is neither board nor SoC specific. It must
be application specific. I can understand that putting it in a board
file seems odd, but putting it in a SoC file is IMO equally odd, and
with the added damage that people starting to write generic DT code
may assume that the SoC will keep on using the same cpufreq software
policy in the future.

Perhaps the cpufreq registration interface should be reworked somehow?
