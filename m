Thank you for your comments.

I comment on SH7760 and SH7763 because Magnus is writing for SH7722 and SH7723. 

I checked these data sheets. Most registers are the same. 
I think that I can merge it. 

Can I check the driver of SH7760 that you wrote where?

And I need found SH7760 LCDC suport board .....

Best regards,
 Nobuhiro
