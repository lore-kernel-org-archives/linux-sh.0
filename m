These seem to be defined in the "arm,gic-v3" DT bindings only, while this is
an "arm,gic-400" (GICD_IIDR 0x0200043b)?

I did notice hi6220.dtsi does have GICH and GICV, while it also claims
to be an "arm,gic-400"...

No idea.

The "clock" node is planned to be removed.

Indeed.

Note that the final CPG node will be the one from "[PATCH/RFC v4 0/5] clk:
shmobile: Add new Renesas CPG/MSSR DT bindings", cfr. the example in
https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/patch/531300/.
