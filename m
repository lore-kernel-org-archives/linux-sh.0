Hi,

this series is a follow-up to "[PATCH 00/16] SCIF, I2C and FSI pinctrl
functions for sh73a0" by Laurent Pinchart. I am primarily posting it for
his review.

This series differs from the series posted by Laurent in the following ways:

* Due to some slightly over-zelous git use on my part the series
  is actually based on a checkout of
  git://linuxtv.org/pinchartl/fbdev.git pinmux-pfc-funcs

  As such it includes several patches not included in the series posted in
  via eimal as the series "[PATCH 00/16] SCIF, I2C and FSI pinctrl
  functions for sh73a0". In particular it includes r8a7740 and r8a7779
  patches.

* I have added the following two patches to update the KZM9G rerence code.

  ARM: shmobile: kzm9g: reference: Register pinctrl mappings for I2C
  ARM: shmobile: kzm9g: reference: Register pinctrl mappings for SCIF

As implied by the second point above, this series is based on
a branch that includes the kzm9g reference code. That branch is

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/horms/renesas.git topic/pinmux-base

Git and diffstat information is provided below to aid review.

Laurent, if you want to change this series in any way just let me know.
I can drop patches indidually or drop the entire series and add a fresh
one from you to the topic branch.
