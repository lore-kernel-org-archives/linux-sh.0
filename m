The purpose of these properties is to configure the frequency of the
clock supplied to the SDHI block.  sh_mobile_sdhi has no code to do that
but these properties are handled by the clock core.

The max-frequency property tells the MMC core the maximum clock
frequency that the host can run the SD bus at, but anyway tmio_mmc and
sh_mobile_sdhi seem to always override it.
