While I'm not completely knowledgeable about gcc,
aren't all the __builtin_mem<foo> functions always
available in gcc 3+

http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-3.0.4/gcc_5.html#SEC114

It does say:

Many of these functions are only optimized in certain cases; if not
optimized in a particular case, a call to the library function will be
emitted.
