Well, from all I can tell it shares basically zero code with the
rest of mach-shmobile, so I would be more comfortable with creating
a new mach-emma directory for this.

Clearly you have an interest in building it into the same kernel
as the shmobile/rmobile platforms, but there seems to be little
technical reason to keep them together. Since we are still missing
a bit of infrastructure to actually build multiple platform
directories together, how about doing this similar to some of
the mach-s3c24* directories:?

You can have a single Kconfig entry for shmobile and emma, but
leave the code in separate directories, and just refer to the
arch/arm/mach-shmobile/include/mach/ directory for the global
headers (they are obviously identical right now). The additions
to mach/common.h can easily become a local header file instead
of getting listed in mach/*.h. I believe you don't actually need
the other headers you currently include (mach/hardware.h, mach/irqs.h),
so it would be completely standalone aside from the header files
that are required for building, and it can still be built
together with shmobile.
