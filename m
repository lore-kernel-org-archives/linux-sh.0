Thanks.

In order to aid review I have made this patchset available in
the topic/r8a7795-sound-v6 branch of my renesas tree on kernel.org.
The topic/r8a7795-i2c-v4 branch is there too.

The above patch seemed to have some fuzz. Please check that
I resolved that correctly.

The above patch did not apply cleanly. I have fixed that and also I
modified the patch to enable CONFIG_DMADEVICES as well as CONFIG_RCAR_DMAC.
Please check this e.g. using make savedefconfig.
