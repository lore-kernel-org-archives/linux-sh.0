Hello Geert,

"Power island" is used commonly to describe the hardware power domain.
I like that one since it conveys the concept of power isolation/clamping
in a power distribution network.  It might be more clear to refer to the
hardware as power islands and reserve "power domains" for the Linux
construct?

Only speaking for the clock framework, but the prepare/unprepare and
enable/disable semantics are very important here, not just the
rate-change stuff.

Does the clk.enable_count refcount for an MSTP "clock" mirror your
statement, "the clock supply to a module is not stopped until all CPUs
in the SoC agree"? Put another way, is it possble in a shmobile system
for an MSTP "clock" to have an enable_count of zero, but still by
physically enabled in hardware?
