Hi Arnd, Ulf

I don't want to use #ifdef in driver :P
OK, I understand your opinion. I can try fix this DMAEngine issue
(without #ifdef :)

But, I want "step by step" for this cleanup.
So, can you please accept about current "header cleanup" patch-set as 1st step ?
Then, I want to try "dmaengine cleanup" patch-set as 2nd step if possible.
I guess [8/9] and [9/9] are not good for "header cleanup" (?) I don't know.
Arnd, Ulf, what is your opinion ?

Best regards
