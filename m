I think patch1 is different, it's a cleanup patch (I just replied to
it separately).

As for subject patch, I think we agreed upon that it's a workaround
but I don't have strong opinion if you want to pick it up anyway.

On the other hand the change won't be needed *if* we solve problem via
driver core. I intend to send a patch for this on Monday, keep you on
cc.

Kind regards
