I copied you on the intro, but all the lists and all the maintainers
was too long to cc. Being late in the cycle I didn't really intend for
this to be for 4.2, but you can pick up this patch if you want to as
it doesn't have any dependencies. If you don't, then I will submit the
whole series for 4.3.
