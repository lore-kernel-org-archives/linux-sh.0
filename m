Hello.

   Here's the set of 3 patches against the Simon Horman's 'renesas.git' repo,
'renesas-next-20130515v2' tag and my recent yet unapplied USB/I2C patches.
Here we add the VIN driver platform code for the R8A7779/Marzen with ADV7180
I2C video decoder.

[1/3] ARM: shmobile: r8a7779: add VIN support
[2/3] ARM: shmobile: Marzen: add VIN and ADV7180 support
[3/3] ARM: shmobile: Marzen: enable VIN and ADV7180 in defconfig

   The VIN driver itself has been excluded from the series as it will be developed
against Mauro's 'media_tree.git' plus some yet unapplied patches in the future...

WBR, Sergei
