Which you should always do when you're going to deal with concurrency issues.
Even if they appear to be obvious, they often are far from that, like in this
case.

Now it is clear what the problem is and that should go in the changelog of the
fix patch.

That is more theoretical, however.

I think that the "Scenario 1" is a good enough reason for making this change,
but it needs to be done with care.

Well, that happens for everyone, but in this particular case we had three
different issues because of a single patch ...

And actually I also should have spend more time on this before applying the
patch, especially given the laconic changelog, so it's my fault too.
