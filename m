	Hi Simon, Magnus,

This patch series completes the migration from kzm9g-reference (legacy
DT based) to kzm9g-multiplatform (ARM multiplatform DT based with
common clock framework).

It depends on Simon's branch simple-pm-bus-for-v3.21.

  - The first two patches fix Ethernet on kzm9g, by adding a Bus State
    Controller node, and moving the Ethernet node to it, and thus depends
    on Simon's branch simple-pm-bus-for-v3.21,
  - The third patch removes all kzm9g-reference support, now the
    sh73a0 generic multiplatform case has the same feature set
    (better, it provides 16 MiB more RAM!),
  - The fourth patch fixes CONFIG_CPU_IDLE=y by adding a node for the TWD,
    which could not be done before, as the TWD driver doesn't support DT
    without CCF,
  - The fifth path is new, and removes the now unused function
    sh73a0_add_standard_devices_dt().
 
Thanks for applying!
