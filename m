I think that an advantage of Abe-san's implementation is that
it might to be a bit more robust. But your proposal is certainly
much cleaner and for that reason I agree it is a good option.

I've updated the patch, but since the code is now all yours
I'm unsure if the author should be changed or not.

arm: Add ARM ERRATA 775420 workaround

Workaround for the 775420 Cortex-A9 (r2p2, r2p6,r2p8,r2p10,r3p0) erratum.
In case a date cache maintenance operation aborts with MMU exception, it
might cause the processor to deadlock. This workaround puts DSB before
executing ISB if an abort may occur on cache maintenance.

Based on work by Kouei Abe and feedback from Catalin Marinas.

v2
* Add some details to changelog entry
* Alternate implementation suggested by Catalin Marinas
  - Add the dsb directly to v7_coherent_user_range() rather
    than the exception handler
