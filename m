Updated the commit message to this (w/o the email word wrapping):

ARM: only include mach/irqs.h for !SPARSE_IRQ

Make mach/irqs.h optional for SPARSE_IRQ. With this change irqs.h can be
removed by converting platforms over to sparse irq.

This may break platforms where SPARSE_IRQ is user selectable and is enabled.
This is on purpose so that SPARSE_IRQ gets properly supported. SPARSE_IRQ
should not really be a user visible option.

Platforms either need to set nr_irqs in their machine desc or all irqchips
used by a platform need to allocate their irq_descs. There cannot be a
mixture. Once this is done, the platforms can select SPARSE_IRQ. shmobile
does the latter, and mmp and pxa do the former.

I agree, but I'm inclined to leave this alone for now. PPC doesn't ever
select SPARSE_IRQ, but enables it via many defconfigs. So I think
changing it may cause some problems.

Any other comments on this series? I guess all the maintainers copied
are happy with it as there have been no other comments. I like to get
this into next now and send pull request to Russell or arm-soc.
