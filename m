My assumption was that it is reasonable to base something on a cleanup
and that as the other base for this is next/dt the this pull request
would also end up in next/dt.

Unfortunately its not quite so simple. The patch

"ARM: shmobile: koelsch dts: Drop console= bootargs parameter"
in renesas-koelsch-board-removal-for-v3.19 depends on 
"ARM: shmobile: kzm9g-reference dts: Add chosen/stdout-path"
which is on renesas-dt-cleanups-for-v3.19.

Perhaps it would be better if the latter had not been classified as a
cleanup. On that topic I must say that I find splitting out
some patches as cleanups to not be a very useful classification for me.

A possibility would be to duplicate "ARM: shmobile: kzm9g-reference dts:
Add chosen/stdout-path" in a revised renesas-koelsch-board-removal-for-v3.19.
I believe that would leave us with only a trivial conflict in
arch/arm/boot/dts/Makefile.
