I'd prefer a better solution to this (such as tracking whether the ETM
block is powered down).  This feels very much like a hack than a good
solution.

Also, the undefined instruction hook was not supposed to be used in this
way - certainly *not* dynamically like this.  While the lookup of the
undef handler is done in a safe atomic way, calling the resulting
function is outside of the locks.
