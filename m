Adjusting the binding after driver implementation seems a bit reverse to me.

The way I see it, first you make a DT binding describing the hardware.
Then as second step, you make sure the device driver support the
hardware and the DT binding. As third or second parallel step you
integrate via a DT.

If you are concerned about the order of the compatible strings, unless
specified by the SoC vendor documentation it is in my opinion up to
each driver maintainer and/or developer to judge if the hardware is
compatible or not. So the development activity of determining if the
devices are compatible shall result in a correct compat string order.
I'm not so sure if it is required that this order is supposed to be
documented in the DT binding. Being more clear does not hurt though.

I think Laurent describes it pretty well. I'm not sure why you feel
that you need to change the driver though, so I wonder if there is
some misunderstanding going on here...

Please understand that all the compat strings included in the DT
binding document not necessarily have to be used by the driver. But
before merging DT integration code it seems customary that the DT
binding needs to be documented.
