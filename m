Most(?) SCIFs have a feature that is always enabled and that asserts
DR even if the FIFO threshold has not been reached if no data is
received for 1.5 frames. Exceptions known to me are SCIFA/Bs, which
require special handling for it to work, and SH7705's SCIF, which does
not seem to have this at all. According to its datasheet, the
SH7751R's SCIF has the timeout feature, so I would have expected it to
work...
