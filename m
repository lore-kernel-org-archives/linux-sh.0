Patches for INTCS have been posted for SH-Mobile ARM G3/G4/AP4. They
will be part of the upcoming .35 release. The merge order dependencies
are a bit tricky, so please apply whatever needed locally for now.

I don't agree with you that allowing people to not hook up an IRQ is a
good thing. The driver already has too many different modes of
operation, adding another one will just make it more error prone.
Trying to reduce the number of special cases is the way forward, not
making yet another one...

Thanks for the LCDC fixes though!
