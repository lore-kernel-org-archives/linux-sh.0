Yes currently the kernel does assume these two things are orthogonal.
The implicit assumption is that if they are not, the driver gets to handle
it. It worked so far, but I'm all for a more general solution in the core
if we can come up with something elegant.

I'm not very fond of either solution really. Can we think of a third
alternative where the pin control core is aware of the constraints and
tries to verify and/or solve the situation?

The idea is to make the code as reusable as possible with
as many checks for physical constraints as possible, so as
to help the driver writers.

To achieve this the generic pin config tries to establish a
semantic on a best effort basis, sometimes leaving "fill in the blanks"
etc, as we're doing engineering not mathematics.

It currently has no concept of sequences or ordering however,
none whatsoever, all such details are left to the driver to
figure out. I don't know if this is good or bad.

OK I see...

I suspect people are depending on this already to varying extent,
depending on the sophistication of the system HW.

OK I'm sort of aligned on this.

This seems like the most invasive action that needs to be taken is
a patch to Documentation/devicetree/bindings/pinctrl/pinctrl-bindings.txt
stating this, and the discussion needs to be with the DT people rather
than me I think. I cannot say much about ordering semantics in the
DTB, but to some extent I think it is already there in arrays and such.

OK if this is a driver detail it's all up to the driver writers.

It is defined in the header file:

 * @PIN_CONFIG_BIAS_DISABLE: disable any pin bias on the pin, a
 *      transition from say pull-up to pull-down implies that you disable
 *      pull-up in the process, this setting disables all biasing.
 * @PIN_CONFIG_BIAS_HIGH_IMPEDANCE: the pin will be set to a high impedance
 *      mode, also know as "third-state" (tristate) or "high-Z" or "floating".
 *      On output pins this effectively disconnects the pin, which is useful
 *      if for example some other pin is going to drive the signal connected
 *      to it for a while. Pins used for input are usually always high
 *      impedance.

Being able to disable biasing on a pin, i.e. by disconnecting
any pull-up/pull-downs through software does not imply that
it is necessarily in high-Z mode after that - this depends on any
additional hardwired electronics, especially if the pin has been
tailored for a specific purpose. It may very often be high-Z
but this is a simplified view of the world and we cannot
guarantee that. Not always are all aspects of a pin under
software control.

> Should "BIAS_HIGH_IMPEDANCE" turn off "BIAS_PULL_UP"?

It is *currently* up to the driver not to allow things that make
no electrical sense, or take evasive action. But I can think of
doing code in the core actually doing this check if it makes
sense to most. Writing and testing patches for this is probably
more fruitful than just discussing it.

The documentation clearly states that this is the same as floating
or tristate.

I named it with the *BIAS* substring since a high-Z bias can
be conceived as a pull-up or pull-down with an infinite resistance.
I don't see any reason to change this, it would just lead to
a massive refactoring of all existing drivers using this, plus it
is already represented in device trees using "bias-high-impedance"
which cannot be changed as DT bindings are perpetual, changing
this would just cause chaos. I suggest to take a deep breath
and live with this terminology. :-)

We have not established any such semantic. It is also mostly
uselesss to do that through documentation or discussion about
it, as this doesn't really have any influence on what people
do in practice.

The only way to have a meaningful discussion around it is
by proposing a patch to drivers/pinctrl/pinconf-generic.c
actually *enforcing* that semantic, and have it tested and
accepted. That is the only way any such distinction would
make sense in practice.

Then we can state the obvious in the documentation...

I would really like to see such a patch, because what
you're saying makes a lot of sense, electrically speaking.
But I expect it to need some discussing and testing
and possibly debugging of existing drivers.

If you want to enforce such a semantic in a certain pin
config driver - i.e. looking for forbidden states in the
set_config() callback when looping over the requested
settings - this is of course perfectly fine.
