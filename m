Hi Kevin, Olof and Arnd,

please consider this third round of Renesas ARM based SoC DT fixes for v3.12.

This pull request is based on v3.12-rc1 which includes the previous
rounds of fixes.

The following changes since commit 272b98c6455f00884f0350f775c5342358ebb73f:

  Linux 3.12-rc1 (2013-09-16 16:17:51 -0400)

are available in the git repository at:

  ARM: shmobile: Remove #gpio-ranges-cells DT property (2013-09-22 21:28:18 +0900)

----------------------------------------------------------------
Fourth Round of Renesas ARM based SoC fixes for v3.12

* Remove unused #gpio-ranges-cells DT property

* Remove usage of deprecated #gpio-range-cells DT property
  from GPIO R-Car

  Property was deprecated in v3.11-rc2

* Correct ether pinctl naming for armadillo800eva board

  Regression introduced in v3.10-rc5

* Add Micrel KSZ8041 PHY fixup to lager board

  This resolves a problem that has been present since 3.11-rc2

* Update SDHI DT compatibility string to the <unit>-<soc> format

  This makes compatibility strings consistent across all renesas
  hardware which currently supports DT.

  The bindings which are being updated where intorodiced on
  a per-SoC basis starting in v3.8-rc7. They may have
  been internally consistent when originally added.
