Well, besides that I dislike everyone inventing his/her own overlay API
and just not having time to propose something that fits everyone your
patch looks mostly okay. Two things:

"That's fine, but you need a Documentation/ABI entry for any new sysfs
file you create." [Greg K-H]
So as far as I understand Gregs statement and your code correct you
should add such thing.

I'm not convinced that you don't leak resources. Is the memory you
allocate with dma_alloc_coherent for the overlays really freed after
normal use and in error paths?


Best regards,
