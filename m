This is definitely not safe.  I worked on a PXA platform a while back
where the only way to tell the thing to "sleep" was to send an I2C
message to a microcontroller asking it to remove power.

Plus, as you say, you may also have PMICs that you need to talk to
in order to shut power off to various peripherals (and maybe even
the CPU itself) during the suspend process.

I2C is one of those cases where devices attached to the I2C bus are
themselves responsible for doing their own suspend shutdown at the
appropriate time; it's not the responsibility of the I2C core to
know this kind of system/driver dependent detail.
