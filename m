Hi Olof, Hi Kevin, Hi Arnd,

Please consider these Renesas ARM based SoC DT Timers updates for v3.17.

This pull request is based on a merge of the following to provide
all dependencies and try to eliminate conflicts. It turns out the changes
in this pull requests are a nexus for dependencies due to modifying DT,
SoC, board and recently moved header files as well as requiring driver
changes.

* The clockevents/renesas-timers-dt branch of Daniel Lezcano's tree.
  He has indicated that this branch has stable commit ids and will
  be included in v3.17. Olof and arm@kernel.org were CCed on the
  thread where he, Laurent Pinchart and I discussed the use of that branch.

  The clockevents/renesas-timers-dt's branch is in turn based on v3.16-rc3.

* "Third Round of Renesas ARM Based SoC DT Updates for v3.17",
  tagged as renesas-dt3-for-v3.17, which I have sent a pull request for.

* "Renesas ARM Based SoC Clock Updates for v3.17",
  tagged as renesas-clock-for-v3.17, which you have merged
  into next/soc

* "Second Round of Renesas ARM Based SoC soc-cleanup Updates for v3.17",
  tagged as renesas-soc-cleanup2-for-v3.17, which you have merged
  into next/cleanup.

* "Third Round of Renesas ARM Based SoC r8a7779 Multiplatform Updates for
  v3.17", tagged as renesas-r8a7779-multiplatform3-for-v3.17, which
  you have merged into next/soc

* "Renesas ARM Based SoC Boards Updates for v3.17",
  tagged as renesas-boards-for-v3.17, which you have merged
  into next/boards

* "Third Round of Renesas ARM Based SoC Updates for v3.17",
  tagged as renesas-soc3-for-v3.17, which you have merged
  into next/soc
