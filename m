Hi,

I've merged this into next/dt. However, a general comment on these patches:

I think you should consider doing a generic binding for the ethernet
controller, that specifies the data that the driver needs as part of the device
tree contents. that way you don't have to add a new _data structure for every
new SoC that implements things -- from taking a brief look at the driver there
seems to be a bit of boiler plate and/or several parts that share common
feature sets already.

Anyway, given the way the binding is written, this can be done later by adding
a generic compatible string that expects more properties, etc -- so it's not
something that needs to be done now. But I do recommend that as you add new
SoCs in the future (if you do).
