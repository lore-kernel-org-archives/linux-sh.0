It's a regression with anything that uses clk_add_alias() or which
open codes the aliasing of clocks, or registration of clocks into
clkdev.  It's quite nasty.

The problem is that the way you updated clkdev, by adding __clk_get_hw()
at clk_get() time, the struct clk which we're passing in there could
well have been already clk_put()'d, and therefore freed, and no longer
valid.

It's a regression ever since the per-user clk patches went in, caused
_entirely_ by those patches.
