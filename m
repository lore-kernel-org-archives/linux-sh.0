That's fine, I am referring specifically to 'cpus' property in the binding:
	cpus = <&cpu0 &cpu1 &cpu2 &cpu3>;
It's difficult to understand what it means without a binding document.
I am not convinced if this 'cpus' property is needed.

That's fine. I understand APMU is needed. But you may need access it as
part of MPCM platform_ops. You can refer [1] on how to use APMU code
from MCPM backend. SPC referred in there has similar functionality as APMU.

Especially for multi-cluster(infact even for single cluster), you may
you need to coordinate CPU/Cluster setup/powerdown which needs to be
abstracted out using MCPM or secure firmware supporting PSCI to avoid
duplication. Documentation/arm/cluster-pm-race-avoidance.txt describes
in detail about the same.

Yes as I said using DT for APMU and supporting it is fine.
But I assume no hardware access restriction from power management
perspective in non-secure world. Otherwise you need to have some
firmware running in secure mode to handle power management. In that case
PSCI is the solution if Linux runs in non-secure world.

OK if your platform doesn't plan to use PSCI, you need to use MCPM to
avoid code duplication as I mentioned above.
