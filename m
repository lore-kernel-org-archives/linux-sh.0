	Hi Simon, Magnus,

This patch series updates the console parameters in the DTSes for
various Renesas ARM boards.

  - For all of them, the serial port config is added to
    chosen/stdout-path, as per current best practices,
  - On some boards (armadillo, bockw, kzm9d, kzm9g), "console="
    parameters are removed from the kernel command lines, as they're no
    longer needed for DT-only platforms,
  - On some boards (genmai, kzm9g), the console alias is changed to
    "serial0", for consistency with other boards (the first serial port
    is always called "serial0", unless labeled otherwise); this does
    mean the device changes its name to /dev/ttySC0 in userspace, which
    also happened on R-Car Gen2 before,
  - On kzm9d, a console alias is added.
	    
Tested on r8a73a4/ape6evm, r8a7740/armadillo, r8a7778/bockw,
r8a7779/marzen, r8a7791/koelsch, and sh73a0/kzm9g.

Thanks for applying!
