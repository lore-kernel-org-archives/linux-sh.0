Hi all

The tmio_mmc SD/SDIO driver is serving very different hardware 
configurations: on the one hand multi-function style chips from Toshiba, 
Compaq, on the other hand SDHI units in ARM- and SuperH-based sh-mobile 
SoCs. Apart from the different native APIs: MFD for the former and 
platform-device in the latter, sh-mobile implementations also have a 
number of features, exclusive to them, which, if implemented in the common 
driver, clutter it needlessly and make its maintenance more difficult. 
This patch series simplifies the situation by splitting the driver up into 
3 modules: the core, consisting of the main part and, on sh-mobile, of the 
DMA part; the mfd glue; and the platform glue. This way also (imaginary) 
sh-mobile systems with additional tmio mfd chips on them can be supported.

Thanks
Guennadi
