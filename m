Hi Mark,

Thank you for the quick review, much appreciated.

It means that some of the bits don't control anything.

According to the datasheet they're reserved, read-only, and read an 
unspecified value that is to be written back without modification when writing 
the register.

There can be one or two registers, depending on the hardware. The first 
register is always required and controls the clocks, the second register is 
optional (in the sense that it's not implemented for some of the MSTP 
instances) and reports the clock status.

They are. Here's the memory map for the r8a7791 for instance.

MSTPSR0		H'E615 0030
MSTPSR1		H'E615 0038
MSTPSR2		H'E615 0040
MSTPSR3		H'E615 0048
MSTPSR4		H'E615 004C
MSTPSR5		H'E615 003C
MSTPSR6		H'E615 01C0
MSTPSR7		H'E615 01C4
MSTPSR8		H'E615 09A0
MSTPSR9		H'E615 09A4
MSTPSR10		H'E615 09A8
MSTPSR11		H'E615 09AC

SMSTPCR0		H'E615 0130
SMSTPCR1		H'E615 0134
SMSTPCR2		H'E615 0138
SMSTPCR3		H'E615 013C
SMSTPCR4		H'E615 0140
SMSTPCR5		H'E615 0144
SMSTPCR6		H'E615 0148
SMSTPCR7		H'E615 014C
SMSTPCR8		H'E615 0990
SMSTPCR9		H'E615 0994
SMSTPCR10		H'E615 0998
SMSTPCR11		H'E615 099C

I've pondered whether we should use a single device node for all the MSTP 
clocks, but I don't think it would be very practical. Not only would we need 
to encode all bit positions, we also would have to encode register offsets in 
DT. This would become pretty messy in a single node.

What about

- clocks: Reference to the parent clocks, one per output clock. The parents 
must appear in the same order as the output clocks.

I might be mistaken, but doesn't "its location in the list defines the 
corresponding clock-specifier for the entry" imply that clock specifiers use 
the location in the list as the clock ID instead of the numerical value of the 
indices entry ? Each entry in the renesas,indices list corresponds to one 
clocks entry and one clock-output-names entry, and clock users reference an 
MSTP clock using the value of its indices entry, not the position of the 
entry.

There's no particular reason, the datasheet doesn't provide any useful 
information. I've just copied that value from existing C code.
