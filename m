Ok, no worries. I feel that there are various CPU related features
that need a bit of testing to make sure support is stable enough to
enable without causing issues for other on-going development.

CPU Hotplug is one of those, another is kernel command line options
like maxcpus, and kexec would be good to have working as well. To make
things a bit more complicated, there is a rather complicated software
stack with trusted code installed by the boot loader, so there is a
dependency on that as well. On earlier SoCs from previous generations
there were issues with shared reset vectors and a watchdog, so SMP
support may affect watchdog too...

Thanks for sharing!
