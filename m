Perhaps I was a bit hasty, but I have already queued up these changes.
And moreover I believe they are useful in their current form for
back-porting to LTSI-3.4, which I have also already done.

So on those two counts my preference would be for any enhancements
to be done as incremental patches on top of this series.
