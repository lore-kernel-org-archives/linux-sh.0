Merged, thanks. You had resolved the board_bcm conflict slightly differenlty
(technically better), but to keep it common with what we have, I added back
the extra line of whitespace.

By the way, you should look into starting to use signed tags for your pull
requests, since it gives you a place to give a short description of the branch
(and that description makes it into the commit with 0 work on our behalf :)
