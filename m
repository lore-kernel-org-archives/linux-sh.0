Subject: [PATCH v2] dmaengine: shdma: fix a build failure on platforms with no DMA support

On platforms with no support for the shdma dmaengine driver build is
currently failing with

drivers/built-in.o: In function `sh_mobile_sdhi_probe':
drivers/mmc/host/sh_mobile_sdhi.c:170: undefined reference to`shdma_chan_filter'

Fix the breakage by defining shdma_chan_filter to NULL in such
configurations.

v2: in "next" shdma_chan_filter() is defined in shdma-base.c, which is 
built if CONFIG_SH_DMAE_BASE is defined. This version uses the correct 
symbol.

This is for "next." Compile-tested only. I'll test it on hardware next 
week, but I don't think it shall break anything.
