To work perfectly, (a) everything must be described correctly in DT, and
(b) this information must be used correctly.
IMHO we can live with the deficiencies for DEBUG_LL.

Not allowing clocks to be disabled until all devices were registered has its
own problems (some hardware requires disabling clocks for various reasons).

A similar horse is currently being beaten to death in the "simplefb" threads...
