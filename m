OK, while you can't mix "real" functions (half of the pins are FN2, the other
half FN3), I forgot you can still configure the SoC to use IO2 and IO3 for GPIO.

Will split in qspi_ctrl (2 control wires), qspi_data2 (2 data wires),
and qspi_data4 (4 data wires).

No, the hardware doesn't support three-wire mode.
Only four-wire (Single/Dual SPI) and six-wire (Quad SPI) are supported.

Thanks!
