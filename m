I believe we should register a new compatible entry for a device when the 
device isn't identical, from a compatibility point of view, to an already 
registered device. In this specific case the adxl346 offers addition features 
compared to the adxl345. It thus qualify for its own compatible string. Its DT 
nodes should list both the adi,adxl346 and adi,adxl345 compatible strings in 
that order, as the chip is compatible with the adxl345. On the driver side, 
given that we don't need to differentiate between the devices based on the 
compatible string (as runtime model detection is possible) we don't need to 
add a match entry for adi,adxl346.
