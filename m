I'm having a hard time working out what these arbitrary 1-3 numbers map
to in terms of actual series and patch numbers. As far as things with an
sh or rmobile impact I see:

sh: ecovec: use the CONFIG_MMC_TMIO symbols instead of MFD

and

[rfc v3] mmc, ARM: Add zboot from eSD support for SuperH Mobile ARM

although it's not obvious how the latter is tied to a TMIO dependency
(some SDHI header thing?).

I'm happy to take the ecovec patch whenever, since it doesn't really hurt
anything. Anything touching drivers/mmc I obviously prefer to go via Chris.

I got buried in the fbdev patch queue today, so I'll be catching up on sh and
rmobile stuff tomorrow. You're free to work out amongst yourselves what gets
applied where in which order, or I'll simply guess.
