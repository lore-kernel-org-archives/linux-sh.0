This is how shdma driver used to work. We used to pass the slave ID (DMA 
request line ID) to shdma from clients from the filter. This was 
considered bad and we were asked to switch to using 
dmaengine_slave_config(), which is the current preferred API, IIUC.

A DMA slave ID (DMA request line) is considered to be a portable 
parameter. I.e. on every platform your DMA slave has to request a DMA 
request line to the DMAC and that line can be coded with an int. That's 
the current assumption, I think.
