	Hi Simon, Magnus,

This patch series adds support for the external crystal feeding SCIF_CLK
to (H)SCIF on the various R-Car Gen1, Gen2, and Gen3 development boards.
This increases the range and accuracy of supported baud rates.

This series is an updated version of a part of a series I sent before as
"[PATCH v2 00/16] serial: sh-sci: Clock Cleanups"
(http://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-serial/msg19762.html). To reduce
(cross) dependencies, I split off the core patches and some DT parts
into separate series.

Changes compared to previous submission:
  - Add support for r8a7778/bockw, r8a7779/marzen, r8a7790/lager,
    r8a7791/porter, r8a7793/gose, r8a7794/alt, and r8a7794/silk,
  - Add Reviewed-by.

Dependencies:
  - This series is against renesas-devel-20151214-v4.4-rc5, with the
    following applied on top:
      - "[PATCH 0/7] ARM: shmobile: dtsi: Add SCIF fallback
	 compatibility strings",
      - "[PATCH v3 00/12] ARM: shmobile: dtsi: Rename the serial port
	 clock to fck",
      - "[PATCH v2 0/7] ARM: shmobile: dtsi: Add BRG support for
	 (H)SCIF",
  - This has runtime dependencies on:
      - "[PATCH 0/2] pinctrl: sh-pfc: r8a7791/r8a7795: Add SCIF_CLK
	 support",
      - "[PATCH 0/3] pinctrl: sh-pfc: r8a7779/r8a7790/r8a7794: Add
	 SCIF_CLK support",
    unless you want to depend on pinctrl as configured by U-Boot (on
    most, but not all R-Car Gen2 boards).
    Note that I plan to get the pinctrl dependencies in v4.5, so this
    series should be OK to queue for v4.6.
    Note that the bockw pinctrl support is already upstream.

Testing:
  - This was tested locally on r8a7791/koelsch and r8a7795/salvator-x,
  - This was tested remotely on r8a7778/bockw and r8a7779/marzen,
  - Testing on other boards would be highly appreciated!
  - Hints for various levels of testing:
      - Change the "dev_dbg" after "done:" in
	drivers/tty/serial/sh-sci.c to "dev_info" to print clock and bit
	rate,
      - "yes U | tr -d '\n' > /dev/ttySCx" outputs a square wave with a
	frequency of half the bit rate on TXD,
      - Modifying the frequency of SCIF_CLK causes garbage on the serial
	console, unless you compensate by changing the bit rate in
	/chosen/stdout-path,
      - If you disable the SCIF_CLK, the brg_int clock will be used. If
	you change that clock, you'll get garbage again,
  - renesas-drivers-2015-12-14-v4.4-rc5 has all dependencies

Thanks!

In personal conversations with technical people, I call myself a hacker. But
when I'm talking to journalists I just say "programmer" or something like that.
