The issue on non-CCF systems is that devices usually can't register clocks 
dynamically. (Most of) those systems provide system clocks only through their 
clock API, without a way for the camera IP core to hook up the clock(s) it can 
provide to the camera sensor. On the consumer side we don't care much about 
the clock framework implementation, but on the provider side we need a 
framework that allows registering non-system clocks at runtime.
