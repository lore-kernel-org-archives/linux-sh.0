Thanks for taking a look through the patches - I'm definitely keen to
hear more from those doing implementations of either clock API.

I wouldn't say beaten to death, I just haven't heard a good case for the
atomic lock option yet (well, until your email..) :)

At present, clk_enable and clk_disable can only be called from
non-atomic contexts.

All other operations can be called from atomic contexts, *provided that*
the underlying clock implementation does not block. I'm not planning to
enforce any rules about the implementations, so this will probably stay
as an "it depends".

Just to clarify - these two examples definitely can't defer the enable,
right?

Sounds reasonable; something like clk_disable_later would be good.

Yep, and my implementation does the same.

I don't currently enforce any locking in set_rate; if a clock
implementation does locking in this order (child before parent), then
it'd have to use a separate lock, rather than acquiring the clk->mutex
in the set_rate operation.

Yes, agreed.

Basically, the reason for choosing a mutex rather than a spinlock is
based on how easy it is to workaround and use it in the "other" context;
ie, how we can use a mutex-based clock in an atomic environment, or use
a spinlock in a non-atomic environment.

With the mutex-based clock, enabling from a atomic environment means
that the callee needs to defer work to non-atomic context, a fairly
standard design pattern which (up until your email) I thought would
cater for all cases.

With a spinlock-based clock, the callee does not need to defer any work,
but it means that the clock implementation needs to enable/disable the
clock atomically. For clock implementations that need to sleep, we can
defer the enabling, but this means that clk_enable() returns before the
clock is actually enabled, which is not acceptable.

If we really do need both locking semantics, it'd be ugly, we could do
something like:

struct clk {
	union {
		struct mutex mutex;
		spintlock_t spinlock;
	} lock;
	const struct clk_ops *ops;
	[...]
};

struct clk_ops {
	void (*lock)(struct clk *clk);
	void (*unlock)(struct clk *clk);
	[ existing clk_ops function pointers ]
};

And provide the corresponding implementations for lock/unlock:

void clk_mutex_lock(struct clk *clk)
{
	mutex_acquire(&clk->lock.mutex);
}

void clk_spinlock_lock(struct clk *clk)
{
	spin_lock(&clk->lock.spinlock);
}

void clk_noop_lock(struct clk *clk)
{
}

Then the implementation can choose the appropriate lock for the clock,
based on whether it needs to sleep to enable & disable. The core code
would then call clk->lock() and clk->unlock() instead of manipulating
clk->mutex directly.

[I've used a union for clarity here - we'd need to do some trickery to
properly initialise the clock's lock statically, or we could drop the
union and steal the mutex's spinlock for the atomic case]

The big downside of this is that the locking semantics are no longer
obvious to the device driver API, which may be getting an atomic clock
or a non-atomic one. As you suggest, we could add a helper:

 clk_get_atomic()

- which would just do a clk_get() and then BUG_ON() if we have the wrong
type.

Any thoughts?

Cheers,


Jeremy
