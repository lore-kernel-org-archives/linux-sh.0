The version you've put in the patch tracker is not the version you
posted.  It contains this change:

diff --git a/arch/arm/mach-shmobile/common.h b/arch/arm/mach-shmobile/common.h
index 476092b86c6e..f2c4bf437ea7 100644
--- a/arch/arm/mach-shmobile/common.h
+++ b/arch/arm/mach-shmobile/common.h
@@ -13,7 +13,8 @@ extern void shmobile_smp_boot(void);
 extern void shmobile_smp_sleep(void);
 extern void shmobile_smp_hook(unsigned int cpu, unsigned long fn,
 			      unsigned long arg);
-extern int shmobile_smp_cpu_disable(unsigned int cpu);
+extern bool shmobile_smp_cpu_can_disable(unsigned int cpu);
+extern void shmobile_invalidate_start(void);

which your original patch did not include.  The tree I'm applying to
(-rc1) contains:

extern int shmobile_smp_cpu_disable(unsigned int cpu);
extern void shmobile_invalidate_start(void);

there.  Hence git quite rightfully declines to apply the patch.

Please fix.

Thanks.
