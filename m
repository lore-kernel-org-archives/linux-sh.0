I don't object to this patch going in, but have you looked at doing
just earlycon instead? We are still missing some fixmap changes
before that works on arm32, but in general, early looks nicer than
debug_ll because it doesn't require you to build for a particular
machine, with the downside that it's not available as early during
boot.

We used to have multi-level choice statements here, but Russell removed
them all in cce278d2034 ("ARM: debug: clean up low level kernel debugging
selection"). Please follow the same style.

This should be done automatically if you call debug_ll_io_init() or
have an empty map_io() callback.
