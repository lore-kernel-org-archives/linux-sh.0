While letting the timer broadcast to all CPUs sounds interesting the
STI driver has so far only been used to drive a single CPU core. This
used to work well for us but has since some time unfortunately been
broken. I agree that it may be suboptimal with a single timer like STI
and using IPI for broadcast, but for more efficient SMP we already
have TWD or arch timer.

This particular patch just does what should have been done during
development of the following commit:

f7db706 ARM: 7674/1: smp: Avoid dummy clockevent being preferred over
real hardware clock-event

Basically, the f7db706 commit changes the dummy clockevent rating from
400 to 100. Our timers in drivers/clocksource all had a rating higher
than 100 so the commit basically broke everything. I can understand
that the CMT, TMU and MTU2 timers were overlooked due to clock event
rating in platform data, but a simple grep would have saved this
driver..

Anyway, this patch adjusts the STI rating from 200 down to 80 so we
now once again are below the dummy clock event rating. So now SMP is
working again, yay!

Thanks for your comments!
