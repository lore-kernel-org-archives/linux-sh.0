    Note that the last time it was in the DT context which is not quite the 
same as platfrom device context.

    I don't have much choice here. Though we could have used used R-Car 
gen1/gen2 terminology (at least in the hindsight)...

    It wasn't me who used "r8a7790-ether" name in the first place, it was 
Simon. And as these 2 SoCs are indistinguishable at least from the 'sh_eth' 
driver's point of view, I wouldn't want to introduce another platform device 
ID, especially as it hasn't been done for R8A777[89] SoCs. What I can offer is 
renaming "r8a7790-ether" to "r8a779x-ether" if you really want.
