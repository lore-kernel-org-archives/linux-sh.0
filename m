Well, it shouldn't change. If something changes, things would be wrong
:)

Btw, Javier is doing a before/after tests on OMAP3. There are a few
fixup things to be added/adjusted (unfortunately, OMAP3 doesn't compile
on x86 COMPILE_TEST), but on his tests, the differences between before
and after, with media-ctl are zero.

As media-ctl is using the legacy API, it shouldn't have any changes
there, otherwise something is broken and should be fixed ;)

I'll spin this patch series with Javier fixes for OMAP at the next 
version of this patch series.
