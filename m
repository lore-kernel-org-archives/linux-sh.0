Subject: [PATCH 3/5] i2c: i2c-sh_mobile: fix ICCH to avoid violation of the tHD;STA timing spec

The optimized ICCH/ICCL values in the previous commit afterward turned
out to violate tHD;STA timing spec.  We had to take into account the
fall time of SDA signal (tf) at START condition.  Fix it accordingly.

With this change, sh_mobile_i2c_icch() is virtually identical to
sh_mobile_i2c_iccl(), but they're providing good descriptions of
SH-/R-Mobile I2C hardware spec, and I'd leave them as separated.
