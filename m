Hm, I think, there's also an alternative solution to this. In 
sh_mmcif.c::sh_mmcif_probe() we find:

	mmc->max_segs = 128;
	mmc->max_blk_size = 512;
	mmc->max_blk_count = 65535;
	mmc->max_req_size = mmc->max_blk_size * mmc->max_blk_count;
	mmc->max_seg_size = mmc->max_req_size;

So, I think, it's the .max_segs value, that allows the block and mmc 
layers to issue requests with 61 sg elements, and, possibly, even more. 
So, maybe we can reduce this number to 32? Besides, I don't think 
"->max_blk_count = 65535" makes much sense. From the header:

	unsigned int		max_blk_count;	/* maximum number of blocks in one req */

for which 65535 seems "a bit" too high. Shall we not set it the same way 
as in my today's patch for tmio_mmc as

	mmc->max_blk_count = PAGE_CACHE_SIZE / mmc->max_blk_size * mmc->max_segs;

? Then we can leave the number of descriptors in shdma.c as is. Paul, what 
would you prefer?
