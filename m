	Hi,

As of commit e488ca9f8d4f62c2 ("doc: dt: mtd: partitions: add compatible
property to "partitions" node"), the "partitions" subnode of an SPI
FLASH device node must have a compatible property. The partitions are no
longer detected if it is not present.

I marked this series as "RFC", as the abovementioned commit is not yet
upstream. Ideally, the users should be fixed first, to avoid breakage.

Tested on r8a7791/koelsch.

Thanks!

when I'm talking to journalists I just say "programmer" or something like that.
