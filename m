When the kernel is entered from the decompressor, the last steps just
before calling the kernel is to clean and invalidate the caches, then
turn them off, and then jump to the kernel.

So, there _should_ be no dirty cache lines which we rely upon at this
point - if there was dirty data in the cache, then it hasn't been flushed
to memory, and we're potentially going to crash because some part of
the decompressed kernel image hasn't been flushed out to memory.

So I'll put a confidence value of 99.999% on this.

The case which might bite people is if they bypass the decompressor.
Even then, leaving bits of the kernel image in the caches is really
dodgy.
