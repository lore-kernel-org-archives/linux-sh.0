Fedora Rawhide has it modular:

 # grep CRASH /boot/config-2.6.38-0.rc7.git2.3.fc16.x86_64
 CONFIG_CRASH=m

 # rpm -ql kernel-2.6.38-0.rc7.git2.3.fc16.x86_64 | grep crash
 /lib/modules/2.6.38-0.rc7.git2.3.fc16.x86_64/kernel/drivers/char/crash.ko

No, sharing the driver is perfectly fine and sane as long as this 
weird usage is not enabled widely.

That's true as well. Petr?
