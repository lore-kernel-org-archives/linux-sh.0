Organization is OK since the additions were small. If there were more
additions needed, doing the enablement one release and removing the
legacy code the release after would make more sense. But here that's fine.

The only thing I'd like to see different is to please send the defconfig
updates separately. They just take out no-longer-existent entries anyway, so
the series should do fine without them here.

So, please respin without the defconfig updates and provide them
separately, if you want to avoid bisectability problems just do them
next release.
