Whether you see it as a show stopper or not is not the issue, I will not
expose sh_pmu generically. Nor do I imagine that the x86 people or any
other architecture wishing to tie in to the oprofile wrapper are
interested in doing the equivalent there. We have a registration
interface to do, and I will not provide oprofile-specific workarounds
for it hidden in the arch code.

This is nonsense. Every architecture that needs to support the oprofile
userspace tools needs to support the string interface. At the same time,
everyone supporting hardware perf events in the kernel today already has
a string to pmu mapping somewhere in their data structures. This can
easily be exposed generically, and platforms that have special mangling
they need to do before exposing the string to oprofile can do so if the
need to.

And those architectures that have opted to use different strings for perf
events are free to mangle them however they want for the oprofile case.
It doesn't change the fact that strings are still being managed by all of
the architectures. The perf PMU names aren't presently locked in to an
ABI, whereas the oprofile strings are, so it seems fairly straightforward
to develop standard mangling rules for preventing an oprofile-facing
string, or to simply reuse the strings verbatim.

Again, this is unacceptable.
