alt and ape6evm tested ok.
I have queued up the changes for those boards.

I would prefer not to take the serial1 -> serial0 portion of this change at
this time as it causes a user-space visible change: the console moves from
ttySC1 to ttySC0. I noticed this because I no longer made it all the way
to user-space which was expecting a console on ttySC1.

-- start before --
[    0.050000] e6c50000.serial: ttySC1 at MMIO 0xe6c50000 (irq = 25, base_baud = 0) is a scifa
[    0.780000] console [ttySC1] enabled
-- end before -- 

-- start after --
[    0.050000] e6c50000.serial: ttySC0 at MMIO 0xe6c50000 (irq = 25, base_baud = 0) is a scifa
[    0.780000] console [ttySC0] enabled
-- end after --

bockw tested ok.

As per my remarks regarding the armadillo800eva I would prefer not
to make the serial2 -> serial0 portion of this change.

As a bonus the  serial2 -> serial0 portion of this change seems to prevent
console output during boot too. I've posted some debuging using earlyprintk
in reply to this patch in case its useful.

gose and koelsch tested ok.

I am wary of the new serial1 alias.
Have you checked to see if there is any user-space visible change
as a result of this?

As per my remarks regarding the armadillo800eva I would prefer not
to make the serial4 -> serial0 portion of this change.

lager tested ok.
I have queued up the change for this board.

Changing &scif2 to serial0 creates a user-space visible change:
the console moves from ttySC2 to ttySC0.

I'm unsure how we can update to use the new syntax without encountering
this problem.

I'm unable to test porter and silk but they look ok to me.
I have queued up the changes for those boards.
