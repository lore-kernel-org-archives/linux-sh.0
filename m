I probably made a similar comment there, now I just did 'git grep slave_id_.x'

I think that would be helpful, but it would not work for this driver as
long as we keep arch/sh/boards/board-sh7757lcr.c in the kernel.

Ah, this is nasty, I had not thought of that case. This makes the entire
dma_request_slave_channel_compat() interface (which I never liked, fwiw)
dangerous to use, because a lot of other drivers will get the filter
function pointer from pdata already (any driver that works with more
than one dmaengine master has to).

I wonder if we should enforce this in __dma_request_slave_channel_compat()
by checking both the fn and fn_param arguments to ensure they are not
NULL before calling the legacy fallback using __dma_request_channel.
