Can't we request this information via PINCTRL somehow? I feel that I
may have asked this before, so correct me if I am going in circles.

If we have a native SDHI WP pin and it is used on our board then this
information is known with the board configuration already. And that
pin function needs to be select. Same thing if we happen to have a
GPIO pin for WP, then that need to be selected as well. And if we have
neither SDHI WP nor GPIO WP then we don't have to bother with the WP
signal at all.

In this particular case based on the information above:

toshiba,mmc-blksz-2bytes
toshiba,mmc-has-idle-wait

or my guess:

renesas,shmobile-sdhi-v1: TMIO_MMC_BLKSZ_2BYTES
renesas,shmobile-sdhi-v2: TMIO_MMC_BLKSZ_2BYTES + TMIO_MMC_HAS_IDLE_WAIT

I think the WP and CD pins should be handled differently if possible.
