True. Though for thermal the datasheet indicates H2 is also quite similar.

I also prepared a very similar patch to add thermal to the r8a7794 (E2).
But the driver reports the sensor is broken - my inspection of the code
leads me to believe its not able to get a proper reading from the sensor.

I'm wondering if anyone knows about this issue. Perhaps its specific
to my Alt board. Or a limitation of the E2?
