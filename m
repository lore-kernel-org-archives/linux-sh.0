I think you got confused by mixing two things: (1) suspend/resume order of
devices, and (2) priority of control.

 1. Obviously a device must be suspended before its bus (its parent),
    and resumed after its bus.
 2. rpm_suspend() et al use RPM_GET_CALLBACK() to get the callback
    that's in control of power management for the device. This does not
    imply order of suspend or resume. That's left to delegation in the
callbacks.

Note that all of the above are for a single device (they take a device *).
Suspending all devices in the system (in the right order) on system suspend
is done elsewhere.

All of this is complicated because you have several different and overlapping
topologies:
  - devices connected with buses, forming a physical data flow hierarchy,
  - device classes and types, forming logical topologies,
  - power domains, grouping one or more devices and buses, not necessarily
    matching the physical data flow topology.
