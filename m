Quite.  Sascha, your mail doesn't refer to the implementation of the
regulator itself at all.  Nothing in your changelog even mentions that
you're introducing a new regulator driver.

I think there's a big abstraction understanding failure here, reading
your changelog I'm not sure you understand the existing mechainsms that
are in place.  You say:

| This patch allows a board to register dummy supplies for devices

but this is exactly the use case the fixed voltage regulator is there
for.

As I think I said earlier I'd use the fixed regulator for this, all
Sascha's actually doing here is adding a wrapper to simplify
registration of that.
