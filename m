Ok, so Exynos is missing one of the other clocks then? Or is the 
pcie_ref_125m clock something that should actually be listed under
the node of the PHY?

Is it possible to treat this clock as a "global" clock rather than a device
specific one, and pass NULL as the device for clk_get?

That's not nice, but at least it gives you a way to keep it out of the
binding, and "just" creates a dependency between the specific PCI host
controller and the way that clock is wired up on a particular SoC.
