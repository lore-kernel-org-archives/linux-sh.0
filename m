This requires the device to have the MSTP clock defined as the first clock in 
its DT node. I'm not against that, but the requirement should be clearly 
documented, and we need to check existing DT bindings to make sure they comply 
with that.

I'd like to also take this as an opportunity to discuss how we should name 
clocks in DT bindings for Renesas devices. Most devices have a single MSTP 
clock, in which case we don't specify a name. Other devices need several 
clocks. Names for the non-MSTP clocks will obviously be device-dependent, but 
how should the MSTP clock be called in that time ? Should it have an empty 
name (a "" string in DT) ? Should it have a standard name ? Maybe "fck" for 
"functional clock" ?
