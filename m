Simon,

Doing each merge of a pull request is an amount of work from us. You sent
a preceding pull request for the soc branch just three days before this one.

Can you try to reduce the frequency of how often you drain the queue
of pending patches, perhaps? I know there's a balance to be had between
merge early-merge often and getting more aggregated, but I wonder if it
can be tuned back a bit to avoid flooding us.

Maybe a good balance would be wait to send the next pull request of a
branch until the previous one has been taken care of.

That being said: Merged.


Thanks,

-Olof
