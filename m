Ok, thanks for the reminder. Do you have a signed tag containing ab6f6d8521?

I merged ab6f6d8521 first, and then Simon's branch, which means that the
linear (first-parent) history is ok, but bisecting the entire state of
the tree may end up in a commit in his branch in a state before it was
merged into mine, where it doesn't contain the patches it depends on,
and as Simon mentioned in his pull request, that will cause a build
failure.
