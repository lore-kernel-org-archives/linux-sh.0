OK, the return type was changed to return the state index instead of the
time, but since the governors are still relying on dev->last_residency,
drivers are required to update it.

Because of that, why not keep the update of the  time/usage counters
in common code rather than duplicating it (9 times in this patch) into 
all the drivers?

Something like the patch below should suffice.
