Thanks for reporting and bisecting!

I had a look and I believe have found the cause of the problem, though
I will need a few days to post a fix for it.

The problem is actually in genpd's ->runtime_suspend() callback, as it
validates PM QoS latencies even when it's being invoked from the
system PM path.
I will post a fixup to genpd in the next couple of days. I would
appreciate if you could help out in testing it.

Kind regards
Uffe
