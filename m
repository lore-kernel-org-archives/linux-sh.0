As far as I can tell we

a) don't allow offlining of memory that belongs to multiple nodes
already (as pointed out by Michal recently)

b) users cannot add memory blocks that belong to multiple nodes via
add_memory()

So I don't see a way how remove_memory() (and even offline_pages())
could ever succeed on such memory blocks.

I think it should be fine to limit it to one node here. (if not, I guess
we would have a different BUG that would actually allow to remove such
memory blocks)
