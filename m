Why is that? Consider two devices using one clock; one does some 
initialisation based on the return value of clk_get_rate(), the other calls 
clk_set_rate() some time later. Now the first device is incorrectly 
initialised.

Regardless, this is definitely something to flag for a later discussion. I'm 
happy to return to that, but we should focus on one issue at a time here.

Yes, hence leaving the locking here to the clock implementation.

Yep, will do.

I'd assume that you'd have to do this at run time, as with any other array of 
structs that contain a mutex or spinlock.
