Done!

I decided to go with SERIAL_8250 && ARM && HAVE_CLK to limit the
exposure a bit but not hinder any single ARM kernel image work. Hope
this balance is making everyone happy.

It is not impossible that this driver can be used on older MIPS based
SoCs from NEC, but that can easily be dealt with later if needed.

Thanks for your help!
