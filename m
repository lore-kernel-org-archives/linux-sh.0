To clarify, is this an MPCore with a single core, or a genuine UP? This 
can be established from the 'U' bit of the MPIDR.

Depending on whether you're SMP or UP (bearing in mind that you can be 
SMP, but still only have one processor!) the IS is ignored in the 
v7_flush_dcache_louis operation:
(from cache-v7.S)

         mrc     p15, 1, r0, c0, c0, 1           @ read clidr, r0 = clidr
         ALT_SMP(ands    r3, r0, #(7 << 21))     @ extract LoUIS from clidr
         ALT_UP(ands     r3, r0, #(7 << 27))     @ extract LoUU from clidr
         ALT_SMP(mov     r3, r3, lsr #20)        @ r3 = LoUIS * 2
         ALT_UP(mov      r3, r3, lsr #26)        @ r3 = LoUU * 2
	...
	flush levels based on value in r3

As you say, for the A9 (from the TRM) the CLIDR reports LoUIS is the 
same as LoUU and both specify L2.

Does that make things clearer, or are you still unsure about something?
