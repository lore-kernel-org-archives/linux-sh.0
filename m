Hmm, I wondered if I need that as cpu_suspend flushes all out to the
L2 as we discussed. So if I don't write anything to RAM after
cpu_suspend why do I need the extra flush before turning off
L1-caching?

Aaaaaah, thanks! I always wondered why this is needed, but that makes sense.

I used to have my gazillionth version of v7_invalidate_l1 in my
assembly code but as it is in cache-v7.S now, I use this.

To be honest, I have no clue if my cache comes up in an undefined
state. But the comment about random data getting flushed to RAM scared
me so much that I blindly go with what other Cortex A9 users do.

It does!

Thanks,
