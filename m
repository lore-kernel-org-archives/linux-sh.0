timekeeping_init() will leave the persistent_clock_exist variable as "false",
which is read in rtc_suspend() and timekeeping_inject_sleeptime().

For all I can tell, you will get a little jitter every time you
do a suspend in that case. Or perhaps it means the system clock
will be forwarded by the amount of time spent in suspend twice
after wakeup, but I'm probably misreading the code for that case.
