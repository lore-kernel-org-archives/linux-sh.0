I hadn't really planned to do a renesas-drivers release today, but as I can
reproduce the hang with renesas-devel-20150218-v3.19, but not with my local
tree, I made a release.

Shmobile-defconfig from renesas-drivers-2015-02-19-v3.19 boots fine on my
ape6evm. It seems there are still +100 mmc commits in -next that are not yet
in upstream.

Gr{oetje,eeting}s,
