I'd think the mmc_test driver already helped me with this. I ran tests
like 31 (Consecutive write performance by transfer size) or 36 (Large
sequential write from scattered pages) which both succeeded without any
warnings printed. And the code explicitly sends a CMD13 after transfer,
checks for busy and prints a warning when MMC_CAP_WAIT_WHILE_BUSY is
set and a busy state is detected. Nice test thing this driver is :)

So, it looks to me that patch 9 is fine to go in?
