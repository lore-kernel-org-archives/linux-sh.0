I tried to convert sh73a0, but it doesn't work, due to problems
bringing up the second
CPU core.

Details:
  - l2x0_of_init() is called much earlier than l2x0_init().
    When the L2 cache is enabled, initialization of the second CPU core of
    sh73a0 (Dual-core Cortex-A9) fails.
  - As jiffies are not yet incrementing at that point (they are on r8a7791?),
    timeouts don't work, and the kernel hangs at the
    wait_for_completion_timeout() call in arch/arm/kernel/smp.c:__cpu_up().
  - This may be related to the intermittent failure to bring up the second
    CPU core when resuming from s2ram:
