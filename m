That's correct.

The clocks supported by the SoC CPG driver are special in the sense that 
they're not really standardized. Most of them are fixed-factor clocks with a 
factor that depends on boot mode pins. The others are DIV4 clocks that vary 
widely from SoC to SoC. Expressing all that information in DT would be much 
more complex than expressing it in C code, which is why I've decided to go for 
a per-SoC CPG driver, especially given that the amount of code isn't that 
large.
