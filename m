Hi Arnd

Thanks for your input.

This means, that a multi-platform driver like, e.g. SDHCI cannot use the 
gpio "flags" cell and has to fall-back to always use "*-inverted" 
properties. Same holds for any other multi-arch driver, using GPIOs. So, 
we're stuck with this?

But in fact, we're not dropping support for those flags. We're just 
encouraging any new mmc drivers to use GPIO flags. Maybe we should just 
change the wording from "deprecated" to "discouraged" and replace the 
warning with a debug message?

Thanks
Guennadi
