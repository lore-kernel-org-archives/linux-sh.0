    Well, not quite: Henninger/Porter is still using 38400.

    That was a recollection from the other board though, I haven't yet tried 
to do it on the SILK board (and I'm unable to currently as the power supply 
seems dead).

    I was going to try that but the board just didn't power up.

    Contrariwise, I'm forward-porting.

    I'm traditionally using the 'renesas-devel-*' tags.
