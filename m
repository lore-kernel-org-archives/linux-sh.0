I didn't actually read out the U bit, but I'm sure I've got no SCU, so
I bet high that it's a genuine UP system.

Ok, this is the golden info I was looking for. So after cpu_suspend()
I am good with the following sequence?
flush L2 (outer_flush_all)
disable L2 (outer_disable)
Clear the SCTLR.C bit and issue an "isb"
flush L1 (v7_flush_dcache_all)
cpu_do_idle

and for resume:
invalidate L1
(trust cpu_resume to resume the L1 and enable the SCTLR.C bit)
resume L2 (outer_resume)

If you could confirm the above sequence, I'm perfectly fine. Thanks
for the quick and exhaustive support.

Cheers,

 Bastian
