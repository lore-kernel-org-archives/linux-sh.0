Hi Simon,

quite some effort has gone into this patch. People from ARM Ltd. have
discussed issues about the shutdown in other threads and I spent quite
some time on it. What are the problems? Are we concerned about the
stability of our system? The CPUIdle feature shut down my r8a7740 on
the Armadillo board more than 1 million times successfully. Further
CPUIdle is deselected as default config anyway. And single
suspend/resume cycles should be even less problematic.

Thanks,

 Bastian
