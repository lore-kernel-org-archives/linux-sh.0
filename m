How do we want to handle maintenance of this new file (pcie-rcar.c)?
MAINTAINERS currently contains drivers/pci/host/*rcar*, which matches it
and says Simon maintains it.  If he wants it, I'd like an ack from him
before merging it.  If not, I'd like to update MAINTAINERS to show who I
should look for acks from.

I don't care either way; I just don't know what to do with this right now.
