Oh, interesting; I haven't seen that complaint myself.  I don't think
there's a kernel-wide rule about this, but I might be wrong.

Personally, I'm happy with receiving the stable@ tag because I like it
when patch authors think about -stable and I want to encourage them to
do so.  (Often they know whether a patch is needed in -stable better
than I do.)

Of course, the stable@ team isn't going to do anything until the patch
enters mainline, and the patch is only going to enter mainline through
my tree after I've had a chance to change the stable@ tag if necessary,
so there's no problem for me there.

Sorry to leave you in the middle of conflicting advice. :-)  The stable@
hint is appreciated in either form; I was just trying to save you some
typing.

Thanks!

- Chris.
