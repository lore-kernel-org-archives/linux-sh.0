It's been another month. Patches have been sent on December 4, pinged
on January 7, we're February 26, and I had no feedback.

Since it's touching a very old SoC that no many people care about
anymore, I do understand the lack of interest. But in this case, could
we please just merge those patches ? If nobody is interested, it is
also unlikely to break things for people, right ?

Andrew, would you be willing to take those patches, which are not
receiving any attention ?

Thanks a lot,

Thomas
