In my long-term "plan" both configs should be available but one should
be generated from the other.  Either way should be okay for me: multi ->
single platform or single platforms(s) -> multi.

[ Please note that if you take multi_v7_defconfig and disable support
  for all archs besides Exynos (trivial operation even when done by
  hand) you end up with platform specific kernel config. ]

Pros:
- less code in kernel
- concentrated testing efforts
- configs don't go out-of-sync with each other
- less maintainance burden

Cons:
- fewer config options may be covered than with two independent configs

It seems that currently in case of our internal kernel trees the custom
kernel configs are always used instead of either exynos_defconfig or
multi_v7_defconfig.  I think that there is a big room for improvement
here.
