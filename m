Subject: [PATCH 0/5] arm: shmobile: r7s72100: add native i2c support

Here is a series to support the I2C core of the r7s72100 natively. It has been
tested with a genmai board where an eeprom is connected. The series can be
found here:

git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/wsa/linux.git renesas/riic

It is based on the latest r7s72100 topic branch from Simon and the latest patch
series from Magnus. Note there is one issue with the current PFC driver which
needs to be sorted out. Check patch 1/5 for details.

Comments welcome. Thanks,

   Wolfram
