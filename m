I don't have any problems taking all of the SH and SDHI related bits, but
since they all depend on the tmio_mmc change I haven't picked them up
yet. They'll likely continue to sit in my patch queue until something
happens with the tmio_mmc changes. Given the response times we've had
with any tmio related changes in the past I'm not exactly betting on a
speedy resolution..
