This one is triggering a new build failure in -next:

arch/arm/mach-shmobile/board-lager.c:99:2: error: unknown field 'register_type' specified in initializer
arch/arm/mach-shmobile/board-lager.c:99:19: error: 'SH_ETH_REG_FAST_RCAR' undeclared here (not in a function)

and it looks to be because this board is trying to use the register_type
field which was removed by:

    sh_eth: remove 'register_type' field from 'struct sh_eth_plat_data'
    
    Now that the 'register_type' field of the 'sh_eth' driver's platform data is not
    used by the driver anymore, it's time to remove it and  its initializers from
    the SH platform code. Also  move *enum* declaring values for this  field from
    <linux/sh_eth.h>  to  the  local driver's  header file as they're only needed
    by the driver itself  now...
