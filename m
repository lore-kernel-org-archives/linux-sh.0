The problem is -- you're adding a likely cache miss on mm_struct for
every 32bit compat syscall now, even if they don't need mm_struct
currently (and a lot of them do not) Unless there's a very good
justification to make up for this performance issue elsewhere
(including numbers) this seems like a bad idea.

Making every syscall slower for /proc/pid/mem doesn't seem like a good
tradeoff to me. Please solve this in some other way.
