XIP should be fine on ARMv7 SMP, which does not require SMP_ON_UP.

Maybe it's enough to describe the dependency in the opposite way and make
XIP_KERNEL depend on !SMP_ON_UP. You should never really need the two
together anyway, since SMP_ON_UP is only needed for kernels that are
meant to run on SMP machines with full SMP support as well as legacy
ARMv6 machines without SMP instructions.
