You're not supposed to set that clock to any special frequency at all.
It's totally up to the board designer. On the AP4EVB board it happens
to be set to 27 MHz. I suggest that you make the clock non-static and
use clk_set_rate() in the board code.

Is it needed by your other patches at this point?

So far the clock routing has been static, so no clocks have got their
parents updated over time. This patch adds a much needed parent
selection support, but only implementing some of the parents does not
make so much sense to me.

I'm not sure which way is the best, but I think this patch breaks the
case when the PLL is turned off.
