	Hi all,

This patch series contains prototype code to enable DT support for PM domains
on Renesas R-Mobile SoCs.

Currently it's limited to R-Mobile A1 (r8a7740), but given the similarity of
the SYSC System-Controller on the various SH-Mobile/R-Mobile SoCs, and the
abstraction of PM domains in DT, it should be sufficiently generic to handle
other SoCs in the future (e.g. SH-Mobile AP4 (sh7372), SH-Mobile AG5 (sh73a0),
R-Mobile APE6 (r8a73a4)).

Despite my request to add support for non-contiguous arrays for onecell PM
domain providers, I went for representing the SoC's power area hierarchy as a
hierarchy in DT, with multiple PM domain nodes, and using "#power-domain-cells
= <0>" (see also the P.S. below).  The code to support a proper hiearchy turned
out to be surprisingly clean and simple(r).

Dependencies:
  - "[PATCH 00/11] ARM: shmobile: r8a7740/armadillo legacy prototype pm domain
    support", sent by me (www.spinics.net/lists/arm-kernel/msg358037.html),
  - "[PATCH v3 0/9] PM / Domains: Generic OF-based support", sent by Ulf
    Hansson (www.spinics.net/lists/arm-kernel/msg357003.html),
  - "[PATCH 00/15] PM / Domains: Cleanups and remove superfluous APIs", sent by
    Ulf Hansson (www.spinics.net/lists/linux-samsung-soc/msg36407.html).

Note that this still won't work as-is, this is just an RFC.
More fixes are needed in sh-mobile platform glue, and to resolve the bad
interaction with drivers/sh/pm_runtime.c and clk_disable_unused().
But none of these matter for e.g. discussing DT bindings.
With those fixed/worked around, functionality is almost equivalent to the
non-DT case.  Missing are Run-Time management of the module clocks
(pm_clk_*()), and device latencies.

Thanks for your comments!

P.S. I did try "#power-domain-cells = <1>", but the hassle with sparse
     definitions and error-prone multiple arrays (not unlikely, but even worse
     than with the SMTP clock specifiers) was just too much. Not to mention
     representing the C5 "always-on" power area...
