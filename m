So, how does the software deal with the clock not being available if the
PLL powers up and takes time to lock and the software goes and tries to
use the device? We need to ensure the clock is on and stable before the
clk_enable() call returns.

For all the drivers I've written so far, clk_enable() and disable()
calls are done from sleep-able contexts such as the mmc work queue
or other such systems.
