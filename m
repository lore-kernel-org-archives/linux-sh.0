Shouldn't the USB PHY driver go to drivers/usb/phy/ or
drivers/usb/host/ehci-sh.c?

We are trying hard to move driver code out of the platform and into driver
directories these days, and having it wired up as part of the platform
the way you do also means it is always powered on.

I see neither big-endian support on shmobile, nor any XHCI (USB-3.0) driver, just
the old EHCI (USB-2.0) and OHCI (USB-1.1) drivers. Are you submitting the XHCI
support and big-endian platform code separately?
