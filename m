While I agree with that, I would avoid having these values for 2 reasons:

1. Others might blindly copy and expect these setting to done in Linux
    or any non-secure OS using DT which is clearly not possible on ARM64

2. Going by your argument, we usually have much more in datasheets
    which are not all in DT, so strictly speaking that's not a reason to
    have it here.

Again I am not against it, just an opinion.
