Your statement challenges the viability of Stable DT Requirements, as we
can thus never write a DTS until the full software implementation has been
completed ;-)

We do know switching off that clock disables the GIC, as per documentation
(and experimentation: lock up), and have used the same strategy with
other Renesas interrupt controllers (renesas,intc-irqpin and renesas,irqc).

R-Mobile APE6 has 2 clusters (4xCA15 and 4xCA7).
R-Car Gen2 has 1 or 2 clusters (2/4xCA15 and/or 2/4xCA7).

If there are multiple clocks listed, the clock controller needs to know which
clocks is to be used for power management.

If we standardize on a name for the clock to be used for power management
(a platform property), that could conflict with the naming in the binding
for the device.
Some device bindings don't mandate clock-names as only a single clock
is used.
Other device bindings do mandate clock-names. You mentioned "CLK" for
GIC-400, others use e.g. "fck", or "ick".

Devices may describe zero, one, or more clocks in the DT bindings. Usually
these clocks are functional, and they are described because the driver needs
to control them, and/or needs knowledge about them.

As all (current) logic is synchronous, there's always a clock that drives the
logic of the device. Gating this clock can be used for power management.
This clock may or may not be the one described in the bindings (obviously
it isn't if the binding doesn't describe any clock, but there can be other
cases).

Any IP core for a device may be reused. On some SoCs, the logic may be
driven by a fixed, non-gateable clock. On others the logic may be driven by
a gateable clock to save power. Whether or not there is a gateable clock
is a property of the platform (SoC), not of the IP core.

Please see slides 37-40 of my presentation "Last one out, turn off the lights"
at ELC2015:
http://events.linuxfoundation.org/sites/events/files/slides/elc2015_uytterhoeven.pdf
They show examples of devices with zero, one or more described clocks.
