If the hardware has scatter gather support it allows the driver to chain the 
descriptors before submitting them, which reduces the latency between the 
transfers as well as the IO over overhead. The flaw with the current 
implementation is that there is only one global chain per channel instead of 
e.g. having the possibility to build up a chain in a driver and then submit and 
start the chain. Some drivers have virtual channels where each channel 
basically acts as the chain and once issue pending is called it is the chain is 
mapped to a real channel which then executes it.
