  ARM: shmobile: r8a7790: Fix GPIO resources in DTS (2013-11-28 17:04:39 +0900)

----------------------------------------------------------------
Renesas ARM based SoC fixes for v3.13

* r8a7790 (R-Car H1) SoC
  - Correct GPIO resources in DT.

    This problem has been present since GPIOs were added to the r8a7790 SoC
    by f98e10c88aa95bf7 ("ARM: shmobile: r8a7790: Add GPIO controller
    devices to device tree") in v3.12-rc1.

* irqchip renesas-intc-irqpin
  - Correct register bitfield shift calculation

    This bug has been present since the renesas-intc-irqpin driver was
    introduced by 443580486e3b9657 ("irqchip: Renesas INTC External IRQ pin
    driver") in v3.10-rc1

* Lager board
  - Do not build the phy fixup unless CONFIG_PHYLIB is enabled

    This problem was introduced by 48c8b96f21817aad
