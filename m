To get this forward I set up a branch with the generic bits sent to the
list so far. I really think this should be fixed better now than later
to give enough time for potential users of the new API to implement it
for their platform.

I declare this to be stable, so assuming people are OK with it, you can
use that as a base to convert your platforms.

@Linus: I hope you're willing to pull this branch after .39?! (A public
"yes" might motivate one or the other maintainer to convert their
platform to it.)

There is a 2nd branch on that repository that also contains my RFC patch
just sent to this list in case you want to test it.
