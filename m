I'm fine with this. Also note that the arm64 commit changing
L1_CACHE_BYTES to 128 hasn't been pushed yet (it's queued for 4.4).

In theory it only reverts the effect for the first kmalloc_cache
("kmalloc-128" in the arm64 case). Any other bigger cache which would
not be mergeable with an existing one still has the potential of
off-slab management.

IIUC, starting with 128 slab size for a 4KB page, you have 32 objects
per page. The freelist takes 32 bytes (or 31), therefore you waste a
single slab object. However, only 1/4 of it is used for freelist and the
waste gets bigger with 256 slab size, hence the original commit.

BTW, assuming L1_CACHE_BYTES is 512 (I don't ever see this happening but
just in theory), we potentially have the same issue. What would save us
is that INDEX_NODE would match the first "kmalloc-512" cache, so we have
it pre-populated.
