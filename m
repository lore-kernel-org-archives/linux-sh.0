Subject: [PATCH/RFC 1/2] ARM: shmobile: kzm9g dts: Declare the full 512 MiB of RAM

Traditionally, the first 16 MiB of RAM was reserved for the RT
processor.  However, this is incompatible with CONFIG_AUTO_ZRELADDR=y,
which requires that the start address of physical memory is a multiple
of 128 MiB.

As CONFIG_AUTO_ZRELADDR=y is enabled for multi-platform kernels, declare
RAM to start at 0x40000000.

While at it, reclaim the last 8 MiB of RAM, too, so the full 512 MiB is
available.

Questions:
  - Why was the last 8 MiB of RAM not used?
  - Is it an option to fix CONFIG_AUTO_ZRELADDR instead?
