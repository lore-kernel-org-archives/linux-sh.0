Unless I've misunderstood, couldn't Linux choose one timer to use completely
arbitrarily?

Why do we need to describe which one to use?

I don't think it's a good idea to expose something like this through the
binding, as it's strongly tied to the current Linux implementation. If we can
always use the device as both, we may as well (other drivers already do). If
the quality of the clocksource / timer is variable enough that it's worth
describing, maybe there's a better way of describing this variability
specifically?

I've just realised some of the variables being assigned to aren't u32s.  While
it'd still be nicer to use of_property_read_u32, you may still need a temporary
variable.

What I meant was it'd be nice to warn the user that the dt doesn't look right
so it's easier to debug when something blows up unexpectedly.

Thanks,
