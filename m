I think this isn't about "responsiblity".  Someone in arm-land found
that the way dma memory allocation worked for some time doesn't work
anymore on new generation chips.  As pointing out this problem was
expected to find some matches it was merged in the merge window.  One
such match is the current usage of the DMA API that doesn't currently
offer a way to do it right, so it needs a patch, no?
