Subject: [PATCH 0/4] E-EDID for framebuffer and sh-mobile HDMI

This patch series adds support for E-EDID parsing to the framebuffer 
subsystem and extends the sh_mobile_hdmi driver to use it. The first patch 
is unmodified patch from Erik Gilling, included here only for 
completeness. Fixes, that I proposed for it are included in the second 
incremental patch. Since the discussion on the fbdev mailing list, 
concerning where and how to implement this functionality to be able to 
share it between framebuffer and DRM drivers, I decided to continue 
implementing this locally under drivers/video for the beginning, later we 
can certainly discuss how to further improve and share this and other 
common functionality between the two subsystems. Comments, as usual, 
welcome.

Thanks
Guennadi
