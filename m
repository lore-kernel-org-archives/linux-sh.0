IIUIC, the only reason the driver source needs the header file is:

#define CPG_NUM_CLOCKS                  (R8A7779_CLK_OUT + 1)

Why not

#define CPG_NUM_CLOCKS                  8

and drop the include?

Or better, use "num_clks" (from of_property_count_strings(np,
"clock-output-names")), like the other R-Car drivers do.

Gr{oetje,eeting}s,

                        Geert
