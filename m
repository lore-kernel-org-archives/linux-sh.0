Sorry, FTR, I meant "simple-pm-bus" here.

The ordering is indeed a good argument. Will update.

Hence:
  - The DTS will claim a compatibility with
    "renesas,bsc-sh73a0", "renesas,bsc", "simple-pm-bus".
  - The driver will match against "simple-pm-bus".

Note that if we ever have a real driver for "renesas,bsc", we'll have to
be careful about binding ordering. "simple-bus" is handled by core code,
 and doesn't prevent a more specific driver to take precedence.
"simple-pm-bus" is handled by a driver, so if it binds first, a more specific
driver cannot take over.

Yes, it makes sense. I had the "simple-bus" compatible entry there because of
the "most generic first", "least generic last" rule. If you don't use the
extra features (i.e. don't touch the clocks or PM domains in the SoC), it is
compatible with "simple-bus". That's more or less how it was in
r8a73a4-ape6evm-reference.dts before the advent of CCF and PM domains.

Thanks!
