Hi Simon,

Thanks for your work on this!

Aren't these LEDs a board-specific property?

I believe the rest of the code is common across multiple boards, so
making it fully sharable would be nice.

Please break out the board-specific somehow, perhaps into
mmcif_update_progress().

Just curious, where does these 32Mb come from?

Say that a board with be equipped with less than 32Mb, how is that handled?

That's sweet, but I don't think I've got anything to do with this
portion of the code. =3D)

Apart from those minor points it all looks very good IMO!
