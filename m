ARM: shmobile: Initial r7s72100 SoC and Genmai board support

[PATCH 01/03] ARM: shmobile: Initial r7s72100 SoC support
[PATCH 02/03] ARM: shmobile: r7s72100 SCIF support
[PATCH 03/03] ARM: shmobile: Genmai support

This series adds initial support for r7s72100 and Genmai. The SoC
is known as r7s72100 which is based on a single core Cortex-A9
and makes use of SCIF for serial. Many other on-chip I/O devices
are available, and support for those will be added by incremental
feature patches.

This initial SoC and board support is providing limited DT-only
support and a very basic C-version of board support. In the future
improved PINCTRL and common clock framework support will be added.

Implemented in same style as r8a7790 and r8a7791.
