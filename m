Hi Magnus,

So one thing that I noticed while adding in the runtime PM support is
that the MERAM bit in RMSTPCR1 seems to be enabled as a power on default
on the chip. (I determined this by dumping the register from u-boot and
poking around in the u-boot code to verify that u-boot doesn't seem to
be enabling this).

Even if pm_runtime_get_sync() and pm_runtime_put_sync() correctly enable
and disable the SMSTPCR1, with the RMSTPCR1 enabled, the clock doesn't
actually turn off.

While I still think that its a good idea to add the
pm_runtime_get_sync() and pm_runtime_put_sync() calls to do their thing
on the SMSTPCR1 side, with the current configuration we won't actually
be saving any power.
