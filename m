Commit 4d27e9dcff00a6425d779b065ec8892e4f391661 (PM: Make power
domain callbacks take precedence over subsystem ones) forgot to
update the device power management documentation to take changes
made by it into account.  Correct that mistake.

 device.  This field is a pointer to an object of type struct dev_power_domain,
 defined in include/linux/pm.h, providing a set of power management callbacks
 analogous to the subsystem-level and device driver callbacks that are executed
-for the given device during all power transitions, in addition to the respective
-subsystem-level callbacks.  Specifically, the power domain "suspend" callbacks
-(i.e. ->runtime_suspend(), ->suspend(), ->freeze(), ->poweroff(), etc.) are
-executed after the analogous subsystem-level callbacks, while the power domain
-"resume" callbacks (i.e. ->runtime_resume(), ->resume(), ->thaw(), ->restore,
-etc.) are executed before the analogous subsystem-level callbacks.  Error codes
-returned by the "suspend" and "resume" power domain callbacks are ignored.
+for the given device during all power transitions, instead of the respective
+subsystem-level callbacks.  Specifically, if a device's pm_domain pointer is
+not NULL, the ->suspend() callback from the object pointed to by it will be
+executed instead of its subsystem's (e.g. bus type's) ->suspend() callback and
+anlogously for all of the remaining callbacks.  In other words, power management
+domain callbacks, if defined for the given device, always take precedence over
+the callbacks provided by the device's subsystem (e.g. bus type).
 
-Power domain ->runtime_idle() callback is executed before the subsystem-level
-->runtime_idle() callback and the result returned by it is not ignored.  Namely,
-if it returns error code, the subsystem-level ->runtime_idle() callback will not
-be called and the helper function rpm_idle() executing it will return error
-code.  This mechanism is intended to help platforms where saving device state
-is a time consuming operation and should only be carried out if all devices
-in the power domain are idle, before turning off the shared power resource(s).
-Namely, the power domain ->runtime_idle() callback may return error code until
-the pm_runtime_idle() helper (or its asychronous version) has been called for
-all devices in the power domain (it is recommended that the returned error code
-be -EBUSY in those cases), preventing the subsystem-level ->runtime_idle()
-callback from being run prematurely.

-The support for device power domains is only relevant to platforms needing to
-use the same subsystem-level (e.g. platform bus type) and device driver power
-management callbacks in many different power domain configurations and wanting
-to avoid incorporating the support for power domains into the subsystem-level
-callbacks.  The other platforms need not implement it or take it into account
-in any way.
