I think the problem in this case is that the pre-boot environment is
essentially nothing but mask rom jumping into head-shmobile.S, which
is something nobody else does.

My understanding is that you can also put a regular u-boot, kexec or
some other boot loader into the same place and get a running system with
correct ATAGS or DT information.

It's debatable whether booting the kernel directly without an upgradable
boot loader is a good idea, but since Renesas have come to depend on
this and it's been supported by Linux for ages (both on ARM and SH),
I would certainly not ask them to remove support for that.

What I think we can do however is move all that configuration into
one place of the kernel that is fairly separate from everything else.
head-shmobile.S already contains most of the special case, so
how about adding a configuration option that enables both the
head-shmobile.S code and contains the configuration for that in
a submenu?
