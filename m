In this case no i2c is involved. The drivers for both pinctrl
(renesas,pfc-r8a73a4) and irqchip (renesas,irqc) are registered
at the same level:
  - postcore_initcall(sh_pfc_init);
  - postcore_initcall(irqc_init);
Hence the system uses the "natural" order from within the DTS,
and decided to instantiate the pfc before the irqchip.

As long as no other device that's instantiated earlier references that
irqchip?
