My mistake, I did a 'git grep' the linux/drivers but missed linux/sound/soc.

Correct. I checked both drivers, and  they behave just like the ones
I included in my patch.

I was actually hoping that you could pick up my patch and send it as a
follow-up to your series once you have a working version. As I mentioned,
the driver changes to remove the slave_id assignment can be done either
together with the base patch or as a follow-up.
