I see.
I can move this code to under driver.
Can I send additional patch for it ?
 - move usb phy code to driver (to Simon, USB ML)

Or should I send multi patches ?
 - remove this patch (to Simon)
 - add usb phy driver patch (to USB ML)
 - use usb phy driver patch (to Simon)

Sorry for very confusing naming.
I fix it
