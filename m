My main motivation is to start using the default values for the various SH_SCI
options from the first 4 patches, but that requires disabling CONFIG_EXPERT.
Sorry for not making that clearer.

Enabling CONFIG_NAMESPACES shouldn't hurt (isn't that also needed for
systemd anyway?), just like the HID devices, or CONFIG_DEBUG_MEMORY_INIT
(it does a few more checks, and defaults to yes).

Disabling CONFIG_SYSCTL_SYSCALL also shouldn't hurt (it defaults to no),
except for very old userland not yet using /proc/sys, which might have been
broken along the way by changed binary paths anyway.

Thanks!
