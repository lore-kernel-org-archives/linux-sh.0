As a note, if we now boot a Lager with DT on 3.14-rc3 series the USB
controllers no longer work with full 2GiB RAM enabled in the device
tree.

Could we work around this by having 1GiB of memory defined in the
32bit memory and then add the rest of the 3GiB from the >32bit
area via LPAE? Will the kernel ever try to allocate DMA memory from
anything >32bit?
