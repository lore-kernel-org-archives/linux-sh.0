We really need a GPIO blacklist driver in the kernel, but for

I am also struggling with refactoring of board files, all over the place.
At least Arnd deleted the Blackfin stuff now, but the misc ARM board
and MIPS stuff still give me the creeps sometimes.

I guess if maintainers of the boards are not there to even ACK
patches we can propose patches to simply delete them.
