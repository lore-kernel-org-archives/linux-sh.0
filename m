Hi Sudeep,

[reviving this old thread, now we're two merge windows further]

AFAIK, there's nothing to be overridden. The cache seems to be configured in
the exact same way with and without cache-size, cache-sets, cache-block-size,
and cache-line-size.

With:

    L2C OF: override cache size: 262144 bytes (256KB)
    L2C OF: override line size: 32 bytes
    L2C OF: override way size: 32768 bytes (32KB)
    L2C OF: override associativity: 8
    L2C: DT/platform modifies aux control register: 0x02040000 -> 0x02440000
    L2C: DT/platform tries to modify or specify cache size
    L2C-310 erratum 769419 enabled
    L2C-310 enabling early BRESP for Cortex-A9
    L2C-310 full line of zeros enabled for Cortex-A9
    L2C-310 dynamic clock gating enabled, standby mode enabled
    L2C-310 cache controller enabled, 8 ways, 256 kB
    L2C-310: CACHE_ID 0x410000c7, AUX_CTRL 0x46440001

Without:

    L2C: DT/platform modifies aux control register: 0x02040000 -> 0x02440000
    L2C-310 erratum 769419 enabled
    L2C-310 enabling early BRESP for Cortex-A9
    L2C-310 full line of zeros enabled for Cortex-A9
    L2C-310 dynamic clock gating enabled, standby mode enabled
    L2C-310 cache controller enabled, 8 ways, 256 kB
    L2C-310: CACHE_ID 0x410000c7, AUX_CTRL 0x46440001

Hence I'll drop cache-size, cache-sets, cache-block-size, and cache-line-size,
for both unified L2 and L1 I/D caches.
