Thanks, I think that is a reasonable comment.

I expected to be more variance between the changes. And in particular
I expected more than one PHY driver to be involved. But as I checked
the hardware on each board, wrote a patch and tested it turned
out that SMSC was used by all the boards. So I was left with a stack
of very similar patches.

In hindsight it might have been better to squash them at that point.
But I too am wary of combining too many things into one patch and
ended up leaning too far the other way.

As I have already queued them up I'd rather not squash them at this point.
