Ok, sorry, I wasn't sure from the previous mail - would you prefer to=20
actually extend their commit messages? As described here

http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel.mmc/12744/focus=12748

These patches are a part of a patch-series, so, when they were submitted=20
in that context, it was pretty obvious how they relate to the rest.=20
However, unfortunately, they are now applied later than the main patches=20
in that series, so, their purpose has become much less obvious, and their=20
main feature now seems to be not the conversion of the affected platforms, =

but fixing the build. So, I think, we could use something like this in the =

patch descriptions:

This also fixes modular mmc build on this platform by eliminating the use=20
of an inline function, which calls into the mmc core.

Thanks
