Ok, these patches now look pretty good to me.

One final detail is that I think the information about the percentage 
of functions affected should be propagated into the help text:

It should say something like:

	  On an x86 "defconfig" build, this feature adds canary checks 
	  to about 3% of all kernel functions, which increases kernel
	  code size by about 0.3%.

and for the _STRONG option:

	  On an x86 "defconfig" build, this feature adds canary checks 
	  to ~20% of all kernel functions, which increases kernel code 
	  size by ~2%.

this way distibutions and users can make an informed decision about 
the level of checks they want to employ.

Thanks,
