Thank you for your answer! I think I'll go for the get/put solution
here.

I have another case, may I ask your advice about this, too? When an I2C
bus is marked in DT as multi-master, then RuntimePM also needs to be
disabled, because arbitration detection needs to stay awake. I am
currently implementing this for the i2c-rcar driver:

-	pm_runtime_enable(dev);
+	/* No RuntimePM in multi-master to keep arbitration working */
+	if (!of_get_property(dev->of_node, "multi-master", NULL)) {
+		pm_runtime_enable(dev);
+		priv->flags |=3D ID_P_PM;
+	}
+
 	pm_runtime_get_sync(dev);
	...

@@ -664,7 +673,8 @@ static int rcar_i2c_remove(struct platform_device *pdev)
 	struct device *dev =3D &pdev->dev;
=20
 	i2c_del_adapter(&priv->adap);
-	pm_runtime_disable(dev);
+	if (priv->flags & ID_P_PM)
+		pm_runtime_disable(dev);
=20
 	return 0;
 }

Here, I'd tend to keep using enable/disable, although get/put would
probably also work. What is the rule of thumb using this pattern or the
other?

Yeah, I realized his today, too.

Thanks!
