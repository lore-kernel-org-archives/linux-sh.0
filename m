That would be very good!

I think you can decide clock source or clock event assignment based on
number of channels available. If you have only a single channel then
both clock event and clock source need to be supported. Otherwise use
one channel for clock source and the rest for clock events.

This is probably out of scope for this DT conversion, but it would be
neat if you somehow could specify the CPU affinity for a channel to
tie a clock event to an individual CPU core. This would make a a
per-cpu timer unless I'm mistaken. But that's more of a software
policy than anything else.

Thanks,
