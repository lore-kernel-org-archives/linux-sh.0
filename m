    I'm adding a header file to include/linux/usb/ which now should probably 
be renamed too, after the driver, to 'phy-rcar-usb.h'. I prbably should rename 
it now, in anticipation, or the one who would resolve the conflict, won't 
figure it out to do it. Or perhaps indeed patches #1..#6 can be merged now, 
and the rest postponed...

WBR, Sergei
