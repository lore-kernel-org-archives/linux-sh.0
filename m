I agree.

I guess so. decompress_unxz.c certainly isn't the right place for those
functions. The arch-specific files also allow arch-specific
optimizations if someone finds them useful.

In a generic case, you can replace memcpy with memmove but not vice
versa. memmove is generally slower than memcpy because memmove has to
support overlapping buffers.

I guess the current comment in decompress_unxz.c could be clearer. In
short, memmove and memcpy speeds don't matter much *for kernel
decompression* which is done in the single-call mode of the XZ
decompressor on archs that currently support XZ. memcpy speed could
matter if the kernel image contained a large amount of incompressible
data, but even if it did, it shouldn't matter much.

Or you can use #ifdef CONFIG_KERNEL_XZ in string.c. XZ_PREBOOT is kind
of internal define to the XZ code so it's not good to rely on it.

If you add a static memmove function to misc.c, compiler can omit it
when memmove isn't used. Since misc.h pulls <linux/string.h> via
<linux/elf.h> and so there's a prototype of extern memmove already, one
needs to call the static function e.g. my_memmove and #define memmove
my_memmove. This way you don't need to #ifdef it to any particular
decompressors.

If memmove is used to implement memcpy, you probably cannot avoid
decompressor-specific #ifdefs unless you use memmove for all
decompressors. The question is how clean code you want vs. how much you
care about saving 30-150 bytes in bzImage size.
