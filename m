...unless the device is already in an existing pm_domain, right?

I like this approach, and it extends nicely what we already do on
platforms using drivers/base/power/clock_ops.c into DT land.

My only concern is how this will interact if it's used along with
devices that have existing pm_domains.  I don't have any specific
concerns (yet, because it's Friday, and my brain is turing off), but it
just made me wonder if this will be potentially confusing.
 
Also...

I would've expected these 2 lines to be inside the pm_domain check.

What's the reason for doing the pm_clk_add() when the pm_domain isn't
going to be used?  I suppose it's harmless, but it's a bit confusing.
