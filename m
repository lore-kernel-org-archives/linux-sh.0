Or at least the driver would need to have some logic for attempting to
make the change and being rejected by the clock framework for the shared
clock case. It should be pretty trivial to make this behaviour
configurable anyways, given that the driver is largely impervious to the
clock refcount otherwise.

If the blocks in question are optionally capable of driving their own
clocks and exposing a wider range of frequencies, then that's something
that should be looked in to as well. For older blocks we're likely not
going to have a lot of flexibility with regards to the clock source,
though.

"Most likely" isn't a constructive performance metric. It's worth trying
out, and if it helps then of course it makes sense to try and support.
It's not really worth going through and adding in additional complexity
in order to support every possible frequency just becase we can, however.

It would also be good to see what's going on with class 2 and 10 here,
given that we still aren't seeing expected class 10 numbers, regardless
of frequency.
