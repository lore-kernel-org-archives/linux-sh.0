Hi Russell,

I emphatically second Grant's opinion here:
This is a good patch series and is a much-needed improvement.

I am in the middle of a board-port for an A9 system, and this
series will greatly simplify things for me *despite* the fact that
I will need to convert to the new write_sec() form of L2C control
on PSCI-enabled non-secure platforms.

To reiterate Grant's request, please re-consider applying
this L2C patch series!

Thank you,
jdl
