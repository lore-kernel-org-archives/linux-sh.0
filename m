Subject: [PATCH/RESEND 0/2] ARM: shmobile: Remove #gpio-ranges-cells property

(Resending due to wrong copy&paste in mailing list e-mail addresses, sorry for
the noise.)

The property has been deprecated and unused since commit
d9fe0039c4247383c2783923a3860227813b4d82 ("gpio: implement gpio-ranges binding
document fix"). Remove it.

This is a v3.12 fix, based on top of the latest mainline master branch.
Regression and backward compatibility issue should not occur, as:

- The first patch hardcodes the number of gpio-range cells to 3, which was the
  value used by all boards so far.

- The second patch removes a property from .dtsi files that isn't used anymore
  since the above-mentioned commit.

However, care must be taken to merge the patches in the correct order. Linus,
Simon, would you like to two patches to go through a single tree, or should
Linus provide a stable branch ?
