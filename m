Well, yes, but I think somewhere something suggested, that 27MHz is what=20
you're actually supposed to provide there. Otherwise your board can always =

just call clk_set_rate(), right? Or what's the preferred way to let=20
platforms set up clocks?

Right, it is not needed, thanks.

Because it's not used yet. Should I implement it anyway?

You mean now or in the future? If now - I don't see a reasonable fix so=20
far... Do you?

Thanks for the review!
