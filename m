	Hi,

The SCI driver currently handles two clocks, an interface clock named
sci_ick and a functional clock named sci_fck. Studying the datasheets of
the SH and ARM SoCs that incorportate (H)SCI(F)([AB]) instances showed
(un)surprisingly that the hardware doesn't have a separate controllable
interface clock.

All the platforms that declare an interface clock for the SCI set it to
the clock used as the SCI functional clock. The two clocks can thus be
merged on the driver side, which is what this patch series does. The
resulting clock is called "fck", and all H8/300, SH and ARM users (both
DT and non-DT) are fixed to name their SCI clocks appropriately.

Support for the "sci_ick" name is kept in the sh-sci driver to ensure DT
backward compatibility, and support for the "peripheral_clk" clock to
not break SH platforms that don't declare device-specific SCI clocks.
The latter can be removed when all SH platforms will declare their SCI
clocks properly.

This series serves as a preparatory clock cleanup for the SCI baud rate
generator clock support series. I decided to keep it separate as this
series has more stringent internal dependencies:
  - The SH patches 2-3 depend on patch 1,
  - The DT patches 4-15 depend on patch 1,
  - Cleanup patch 16 depends on SH patch 2.

Thanks for your comments!

Changes compared to v1:
  - Take over the patches from Laurent,
  - Add Acked-by,
  - Handle EPROBE_DEFER,
  - Add missing patches to convert r8a7795 and h8300.
