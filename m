I've reviewed the patches and they look fine to me.

Does this call for the following patch on top of 05/05 ?

Subject: [PATCH] ARM: shmobile: kzm9d-reference: Drop -reference compatible
 string

The only system compatible string used for the KZM9D board is
"renesas,kzm9d". Drop support for the old "renesas,kzm9d-reference"
compatible string.
