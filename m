	Hi Simon, Magnus,

This series improves PM domain support for r8a7740/armadillo800eva legacy,
mimicking (parts of) the existing PM domain support for sh7372/mackerel.

More specifically, they
  - Add missing devices to existing PM domains,
  - Add missing PM domains, hooking up devices and subdomains,

Changes in v2:
  - Dropped FIXMes on behavior that turned out to be expected,
  - Hook up the HDMI-Link hardware block,
  - Really add the A4MP and D4 PM domains, as fixes are available (see
    dependencies below),
  - Move special CPU domain handling from A4S to A3SM,

There are a few dependencies to make resume from s2ram work:
  - "[PATCH/RFC] fbdev: sh_mobile_hdmi: Re-init regs before irq re-enable on
    resume",
  - "[PATCH] ARM: hw_breakpoint: Trap undef instruction exceptions on wake-up",
    or an alternative solution.

Apart from that, I'm not aware of any regressions (except perhaps for USB,
which I was unable to get working anyway).

Please note that DT/multi-platform PM domain support is added in an (almost)
independent series.

Thanks!
