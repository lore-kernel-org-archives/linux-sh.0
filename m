The vmalloc overlap range check will be gone in v3.11-rc1, but that 
unfortunately won't fix our issue. The kernel now fails to boot with

BUG: not creating mapping for 0x41000000 at 0xb9000000 in user region

Further investigation showed that the problem lies in a wrong dynamic 
PHYS_OFFSET computation, in __fixup_pv_table (arch/arm/kernel/head.S). The 
code assumes that the kernel is loaded at the beginning of the physical memory 
and thus computes a PHYS_OFFSET of 0x48000000. The value is stored in 
__pv_phys_offset, later used in the __phys_to_virt() implementation.

When adding low memory the base physical address 0x41000000 is erroneously 
converted to a virtual address of 0xb9000000 instead of 0xc0000000, which 
leads to the bug.

I'm pretty new to early boot code, so don't really see a way to compute the 
PHYS_OFFSET without assuming that the kernel is loaded at the beginning of the 
physical memory.
