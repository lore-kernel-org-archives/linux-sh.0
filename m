Hi Kevin, Hi Olof, Hi Arnd,

please consider this second round of Renesas ARM based SoC fixes for v3.13.
It is based on the first round of fixes, tagged as renesas-fixes-for-v3.13,
which you have previously pulled.


The following changes since commit 23de2278ebc3a2f971ce45ca5e5e35c9d5a74040:

  ARM: shmobile: r8a7790: fix shdi resource sizes (2013-12-19 18:14:48 +0900)

----------------------------------------------------------------
Second Round of Renesas ARM based SoC Fixes for v3.13

* r8a7790 (R-Car H2) based Lager board

  - Correct SHDI resource sizes

    This bug has been present since sdhi resources were added to the r8a7790 by
    8c9b1aa41853272a ("ARM: shmobile: r8a7790: add MMCIF and SDHI DT
    templates") in v3.11-rc2.

* r8a7778 (R-Car M1) based Bock-W board

  - Correct DMA mask

    This resolves a regression introduced by 4dcfa60071b3d23f
    ("ARM: DMA-API: better handing of DMA masks for coherent allocations")
    in v3.12-rc1.

* r8a7740 (R-Mobile A1) based Armadillo board

  - Add PWM backlight power supply

    This resolves a regression introduced by 22ceeee16eb8f0d0
    ("pwm-backlight: Add power supply support") in v3.12.
