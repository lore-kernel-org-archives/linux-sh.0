Subject: [PATCH v2 00/13] Remove platform callbacks from mmc_spi, sh_mmcif and sh_mobile_sdhi drivers

Hello,

This patch set replaces callbacks to board code with regulators and GPIOs in
the mmc_spi, sh_mmcif and sh_mobile_sdhi MMC drivers.

Most of the required infrastructure is in place already on the drivers side,
except for CD debouncing support in the MMC core and CD/RO GPIOs support in
the mmc_spi driver. The series thus starts with patches 01/13 and 02/13 that
add those features to the MMC core and mmc_spi driver.

Patches 03/13 to 06/13 remove the board callbacks from the ecovec24 and
vision_ep9307 boards. The code has been compile-tested only as I don't have
access to those boards.

Patches 07/13 to 13/13 then proceed to remove the callbacks from the drivers
themselves and from the platform data structures.

This will be a bit messy to merge, as the series interleaves patches for
drivers and board files. Given that the mmc_spi driver is marked as orphan in
MAINTAINERS and that the vision_ep9307 hasn't seen any board-specific
modification in the last couple of kernel versions one option would be to
merge all patches (or at least patches 01/13 to 07/13) through Simon's tree if
all involved maintainers agree.

If patch 01/13 should better be merged through the MMC tree (in which case
02/13 should go through that tree as well), the two patches should be applied
first to the MMC tree, and a stable branch will be needed for Simon to base
the rest of the series on.

The series is based on tag renesas-devel-20130730v2 from
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/horms/renesas.git
