Hi Kevin, Hi Olof, Hi Arnd,

please consider this third round of Renesas SH SCI updates for v3.14.

This pull request is based on a merge of the following:

* Renesas SH based SoC updates for v3.14,
  tagged as renesas-sh-soc-for-v3.14, which I will
  also send a pull-request for today.

* Third Round of Renesas ARM based SoC updates for v3.14,
  tagged as renesas-soc3-for-v3.14, which I will
  also send a pull-request for today.

Both of the above branches are based on

* Second Round of Renesas SH SCI Updates for v3.14
  tagged as renesas-sh-sci2-for-v3.14, which I will
  also send a pull-request for today.

The reason for this merge is to provide dependencies for the
patches in this series. In a nutshell there was a round of
driver updates, followed by SoC updates to use the new driver code,
followed by more driver updates.
