Yes, that's obviously a thinko. I forgot, that mmc also switches between 
different voltages, not only powers on and off.

Well, I certainly understand, that a dummy regulator cannot switch power 
by itself:-) Well, theoretically it can happen, that the board code / OF 
is missing the required entry and a shared regulator will be powered off, 
that also powers mmc, but that's obviously a bug.

I was thinking about what to use to power off the card if both a platform 
callback (legacy) and a regulator are available (see, e.g., "[PATCH 
08/29] mmc: sh_mmcif: add regulator support"). But perhaps giving 
preference to the regulator is bogus. Maybe I should just switch both, or 
even give preference to the call-back. What do you think? Switching both 
is, perhaps, the safest bet.
