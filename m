Thank you for the comment.
After I sent the previous email, I was also confusing this behavior.
So, I fixed it in v5 patch.
(In other words, if the PWM is enabled and a user input invalid values,
 this driver will report an error.)

I'm sorry, I should have explained that in this email thread.

Yes, I really want to avoid to set a zero duty cycle because
the PWM doesn't accept it.
(According to the datasheet, it said "Setting H'000 is prohibited.")
