If I could be so bold as to summarise the concerns they are:

* On the one hand there is a desire to make configuration as simple as
  possible. If I understand things correctly this is the main motivation
  for requesting the removal of ARCH_R8A7795.

* On the other hand there is a desire to give users the flexibility to
  easily configure their kernel for a single Renesas SoC. In particular
  to make sure that the appropriate PFC (PINCTRL) and CPG (CLK) drivers are
  present. A key reason that users want such flexibility is to reduce
  the size of their kernels: in particular the PFC drives are rather large.

With the above in mind I wonder if a good solution would be to keep
ARCH_R8A7795 but to guard it with CONFIG_EXPERT.

Non-expert users would get all Renesas SoCs if the Renesas family is
selected: the simple configuration that I believe Catalin desires.
While expert users would have an easy way to select specific SoCs once
they have enabled EXPERT. Not a terrible burden for them in my opinion.
