This seems scary to me. The bootloader should be doing this before jumping to
Linux. As CNTCR is only writeable from the secure side, you won't be able to
use KVM unless the bootloader has done this.

Additionally, if you didn't do this in Linux, as far as I can see you wouldn't
need an init_time callback at all...

Thanks,
Mark.
