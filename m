I think its more on the side of implementing the capabilities of
the intc driver than being simplified.

Although some effort has gone into this patchset my primary
aim is to provide something that provides the basis for supporting
the INTC controller on all existing boards.

I more than open to concrete ideas of how this can be achieved in agreeable way.

I'm not sure that I see what you are getting at here.
