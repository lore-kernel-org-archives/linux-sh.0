Note that that "proper solution" should still involve having 
dma_common_mmap() since we certainly don't want an explosion of code 
duplication. It just means that architectures that do use it should be 
defining their dma_map_ops with an explicit ".mmap = dma_common_mmap" 
instead of relying on dma_mmap_attrs() calling it by default. Thus the 
more architectures this implementation *is* definitely safe for, the 
better :)
