A prepared but not submitted transaction is not a pending transaction.

The split is necessary so that a callback can be attached to the
transaction.  This partially comes from the async-tx API, and also
gets a lot of use with the slave API.

The prepare function allocates the descriptor and does the initial
setup, but does not mark the descriptor as a pending transaction.
It returns the descriptor, and the caller is then free to add a
callback function and data pointer to the descriptor before finally
submitting it.  This sequence must occur in a timely manner as some
DMA engine implementations hold a lock between the prepare and submit
callbacks (Dan explicitly permits this as part of the API.)

Why do you think that DMA_PRIVATE has a bearing in the callbacks?  It
doesn't.  DMA_PRIVATE is all about channel allocation as I explained
yesterday, and whether the channel is available for async_tx usage.

A channel marked DMA_PRIVATE is not available for async_tx usage at
any moment.  A channel without DMA_PRIVATE is available for async_tx
usage until it is allocated for the slave API - at which point the
generic DMA engine code will mark the channel with DMA_PRIVATE,
thereby taking it away from async_tx API usage.  When the slave API
frees the channel, DMA_PRIVATE will be cleared, making the channel
available for async_tx usage.

So, basically, DMA_PRIVATE set -> async_tx usage not allowed.
DMA_PRIVATE clear -> async_tx usage permitted.  It really is that
simple.

dmaengine_* are generally the interface functions to the DMA engine code,
which have been recently introduced to avoid the multiple levels of
pointer indirection having to be typed in every driver.

dma_async_* are the DMA engine interface functions for the async_tx API.

dma_* predate the dmaengine_* naming, and are probably too generic, so
should probably end up being renamed to dmaengine_*.

txd_* are all about the DMA engine descriptors.

async_tx_* are the higher level async_tx API functions.
