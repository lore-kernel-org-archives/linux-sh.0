Ok, now I think I see what you are getting at.

MSTP016 is for channel 0..n of TMU0
MSTP015 is for channel 1..n of TMU1
MSTP014 is for channel 2..n of TMU2

And all the TMU values set by CLKDEV_DEV_ID statements above
relate to channels of TMU0.

That does seem to be a valid interpretation of the documentation
now that I read it again.
