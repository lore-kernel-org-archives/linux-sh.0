I appreciate this is difficult, but I disagree that it's impossible ;)

If you don't want to do clock management currently, don't describe the
clock controller, have some FW/loader pre-program the clocks, and list
fixed-clocks in the DTB. This DTB should continue to work, but a new
kernel alone won't give you fancy clock management. This is what we
expect in terms of stable DTBs.

When you add clock controller support, you need a different DT to
describe the clock controller anyway. You can have it nuke the clock
configuration at boot time as a test that everything you need is
described.

It looks like we should be able to read the GICD_IIDR to figure out what
imlpementation is used. Could you see what GICD_IIDR reports on those
platforms? There's a patch at the end of the email to do so.

The clock-names should be device-binding specific. Nothing else should
be there. If you want to do fancy maangement of device clocks, the
device drivers should register with the appropriate frameworks to do so,
and nothing else needs to inspect the clock-names for the device itself.

I agree that the provider of any clock (and it's feature such as
gateability) is not device specific. 

What I am saying is that the set of input lines on an IP block (to which
clocks may be connected) are a property of that IP block. As mentioned
above, GIC-400 always has a clock input line called "CLK", though this
could be wired to arbitrary clock providers, which might call their
output line arbitrary names (e.g. "GIC_CLK").

If bindings are missing functional clocks, those can be added to the
bindings, and we can warn when they are not present. These clocks are
all specific to the particular IP blocks however, so applying an
SoC-specific naming policy to these does not make sense.

Thanks,
Mark.

Subject: [PATCH] irqchip: gic: report GICD_IIDR

The GICD_IIDR register provides information about the implementer and
revision of the GIC distributor. In some cases this information is
useful for debugging, so log this when probing the GIC.
