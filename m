Even with a NULL clk->ops->prepare function, we still want drivers to
have called clk_prepare().  So we can do something like:

	if (WARN_ON(clk->prepare_count =3D 0))
		return -EINVAL;

in clk_enable() should be sufficient and noisy enough not to be missed.

I'd avoid BUG_ON() here as that will take the system down, which may
increase the chances of getting useful bug reports.
