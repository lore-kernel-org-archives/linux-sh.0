    So what?

    Well, not couple. :-P

    Well, it was my first variant. However, not knowing the hardware well, I 
deemed it not quite safe to clear the DMA bit before shutting down the DMA 
channels, so came up with the second version (which I consider more logically 
correct).

    I tried it but mystically fixing the PIO fallback makes DMA error less 
frequent. IIRC, I didn't see DMA error with the first variant of the fix, so 
I'll have to retry it...
