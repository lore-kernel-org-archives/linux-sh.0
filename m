a "real" compatible value should have vendor,device syntax.

we had some discussions in the past how to represent i2c master devices in 
device tree. The outcome was to use to a special representation to distinguish 
them from slave devices, e.g. something like reg = <0x1 0x64>, where the 0x1 
would mean "master" device (0x0 -> slave). If nothing is added, then it's also 
slave. The adapter address cell would also need to be changed if this 
extension is used.

An alternative would be to use a special property (e.g. slave address), but 
that would encode the same value twice (or even three times).
