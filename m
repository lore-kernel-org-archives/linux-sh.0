Something like that, I think the QVGA LCD panel on Migo-R does not
expose the VSYNC pin of the on-panel LCD controller so there is
nothing to connect to the sh7722.

It may be difficult to test your patch because of this, I'm not sure.
My main concern was just to double check that you've thought about
dealing with both the deferred io case and the "regular" non-deferred
io case. The sh7724 KFR2R09 board is using deferred io and I think
some upcoming boards may make use of that as well, so I'd prefer to
keep that case working. =)

Cheers,
