Sure, if the hardware is very similar, it makes sense to share code. I've had 
a quick look at the M2 documentation, and it seems to be indeed mostly 
identical to H2. Only a couple of clocks are missing, and a new GPU clock 
register is documented. As the GPU clock is mentioned in the H2 documentation 
as being programmable I would assume that the GPU clock register exists and is 
identical in H2 but has been forgotten in the documentation.

We should probably extend clock-r8a7790.c with M2 support and rename it to 
clock-rcar-gen2.c before pushing it to mainline. Would you like to submit a 
patch ? :-)
