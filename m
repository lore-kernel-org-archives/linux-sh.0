> This series adds initial support for r8a73a4 and APE6EVM. The SoC
> is known as r8a73a4 which is built around Cortex-A15 and makes use
> of SCIF for serial and IRQC interrupt controller for external IRQs.
> 
> This initial SoC and board support is providing limited DT-only
> support and a very basic C-version of board support. In the future
> improved PINCTRL and clock framework support will be added, followed
> by SMP support.
