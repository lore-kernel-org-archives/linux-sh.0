Hello,

This series contains a couple of build fixes and cleanups for the
Media Controller framework. The goal of the series is to get rid of
the struct media_entity .parent member since now that a media_gobj is
embedded into entities, the media_gobj .mdev member can be used to
store a pointer to the parent struct media_device.

So the .parent field becomes redundant and can be removed after all
the users are converted to use entity .graph_obj.mdev instead.

Patches 1/4 and 2/4 are build fixes I found while build testing if no
regressions were introduced by the conversion. Patch 3/4 converts
all the drivers and the MC core to use .mdev instead of .parent and
finally patch 4/4 removes the .parent field since now is unused.

The series depend on Mauro's "[PATCH v6 0/8] MC preparation patches
series" [0].

The transformation were automated using a coccinelle semantic patch
and the drivers were build tested using allyesconfig and x-building
the ARM Exynos and OMAP defconfigs + the needed media config options.

Best regards,
Javier
