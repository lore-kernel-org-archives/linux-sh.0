A couple comments/questions:

Wouldn't the 'wakeup' hook be better named platform_device_enable().
The _wakeup name seems to imply that the call will perform some sort
of wakeup, but all it's really doing is enabling it by turning it on
or taking it out of idle.

In the process of discussing a similar interface for OMAP, we dicussed
that having 3 states would be more useful.  Specifically, and
_enable(), _idle() and _disable() hook.  The _enable() and _idle()
hooks being exactly what you proposed above, but with the addition of
a _disable() hook which says not only can the device go idle, but that
the driver is really finished with the device.  In this case, more
aggresive PM measures could be taken, such as turning of regulators
that may have long latencies that may not be appropriate to turn off
in idle.

I'm interested in any thoughts there because the line between _idle()
and _disable() remains a little fuzzy to me still.  For exmaple, maybe
the _idle() call in combination with latency constraints in PM QoS
could do effectively the same thing as _disable().
