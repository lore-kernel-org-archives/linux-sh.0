Subject: [PATCH v5 00/20] ARM: shmobile: r8a7779, marzen: CCF and multiplatform

The aim of this series is to add common clock framework and in turn
multiplatform support to the r8a7779 SoC and marzen-reference.  It
subsequently removes non-multiplatform support from marzen-reference.

This is based on work for R-Car Gen2 by Laurent Pinchart and Magnus Damm.


This series attempts to address the  review received for v4 of this series.
Changes are noted in the changelog of individual patches.


Applied on top of the renesas-devel-v3.15-rc1-20140415 tag of
my renesas tree.

Requires the following patch for correct runtime operation:

spi: sh-hspi: Do not specifically request shyway_clk clock

Caveats:

* SMSC_PHY is known not to work with marzen though the reason for
  this is not known. As this is selected in the shmobile_defconfig
  it should be manually disabled before compiling that configuration
  for use on Marzen.

* Does not appear to work with SMP. A work around is to use maxcpus=1.
