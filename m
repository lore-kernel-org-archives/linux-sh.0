This all looks like a pointless abstraction. This is basically a verbatim
copy of the sh_clk_mstp32 routines.

I suppose this is a case where you want to use the mstp32 routines but
don't specifically have div4/div6 clocks to manage so you aren't setting
SH_CLK_CPG. Perhaps we should just move the sh_clk_mstp32 stuff out so
it's provided regardless of the CPG setting and rename it to drop the
mstp32 connotations. It's really only the div4/div6 stuff that has any
CPG-specific behaviour at this point anyways.
