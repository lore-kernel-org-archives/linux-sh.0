There is an easy way to "smoke test" it on all archiectures that also 
implement kprobes (which powerpc does).  If I'm understanding the 
powerpc code correctly (WRT register naming conventions) just do the 
following:

cd /sys/kernel/debug/tracing
echo 'p do_fork %gpr0' > kprobe_events
echo 1 > events/kprobes/enable
ls
cat trace
echo 0 > events/kprobes/enable

Every fork() call done on the system between those two echo commands 
(hence the "ls") should append a line to the trace file.  For a more 
exhaustive test one could repeat this sequence for every register in the 
architecture.

This should work the same on all architectures supporting kprobes.  You 
just have to use the appropriate register names for your architecture 
after the "%".
