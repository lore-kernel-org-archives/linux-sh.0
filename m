Do you know of somewhere I can buy a card with this chipset in the EU? I had a
quick search but couldn't find anything.

Ah, yes you are correct.

Ha, yes I didn't notice that :)

I'll look at it.

I used the tegra driver to inform on what I should do for this. This doesn't
call pci_add_resource() for I/O space either. However, I also see that other
drivers do call this. I think the simplest thing is for me to get a card that
supports I/O space and properly test it.

Yeah, that's why I said it should, not does. It only clears those bits in the
register's current value.

Right, I see... this is rather a mess with all the host drivers!

Ah, so we currently have a half-way house... not failing the probe, but not
enabling the HW. Either all or nothing would be preferable.
