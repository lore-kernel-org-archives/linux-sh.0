This is all about wanting sane defaults and keeping the code simple.
Using GPIOs covers 100% of all use cases on R-Car Gen2 and it allows
us to use generic DT properties in the board DTS to enable WP and CD.
Any other native CD or WP handling is just a corner case.

You may be confused by the difference between the R-Car Gen1 case and
the R-Car Gen2 case when it comes to CD and WP handling in the SDHI
driver. The reason why we don't rely 100% on GPIO for Gen1 is that the
GPIO hardware does not support IRQ trigger with both edges. In R-Car
Gen2 case the GPIO should cover all pins on the system and allows for
both edge trigger.

Using the native CD (and maybe WP) functionality of the SDHI hardware
may conflict with Runtime PM. Ideally we want to be able to disable
the clock and power domain when no card is inserted or the card is
in-use but idle. Using GPIO helps us with that.

The _card_ may end up read-only if WP is used incorrectly.

So why would we want to have multiple overlapping ways of handling the
WP signal?

Are you sure about this? If you find a bug then please report it,
otherwise I can think of more interesting things to spend time on.
