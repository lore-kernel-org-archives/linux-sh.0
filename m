	Hi Simon, Magnus,

This patch series prepares kzm9g and kzm9g-reference dts for booting a
multi-platform kernel.

Traditionally, the first 16 MiB of RAM was reserved for the RT
processor.  However, this is incompatible with CONFIG_AUTO_ZRELADDR=y,
which requires that the start address of physical memory is a multiple
of 128 MiB.

As CONFIG_AUTO_ZRELADDR=y is enabled for multi-platform kernels, declare
RAM to start at 0x40000000.

While at it, reclaim the last 8 MiB of RAM, too, so the full 512 MiB is
available. We don't know the exact reason why the last 8 MiB of RAM
was reserved, but thanks to Simon we know it is not used for a U-Boot
splash screen.  Note that kzm9g_defconfig still has
CONFIG_MEMORY_START=0x41000000 and CONFIG_MEMORY_SIZE=0x1f000000, so
before the advent of DT we scribbled over the last 8 MiB, too.

This is an alternative solution for "[PATCH v2 01/05] ARM: shmobile:
kzm9g-reference: 0x48008000 load address"
(http://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-sh/msg38385.html), which
(a) doesn't loose 112 MiB of RAM, and
(b) doesn't force to switch from zImage to uImage.

Thanks for applying!
