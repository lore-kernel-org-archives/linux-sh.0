Subject: [PATCH v3 0/8] Renesas R-Car Gen2 Common Clock Framework support

Hello,

This is the third version of the CCF clock drivers for the Renesas R-Car
R8A7790 (H2) and R8A7791 (M2) SoCs.

The patches are pretty self-explanatory and described in their respective
commit message. The R8A7790 and R8A7791 datasheets are unfortunately not
publicly available.

The code is available in my git tree at

        git://linuxtv.org/pinchartl/fbdev.git clocks/ccf/rcar-gen2

The branch is based on the clk-prepare patches I've posted earlier on the list
("[PATCH 00/12] Prepare various SH/R Mobile/Car drivers for CCF migration"),
themselves rebased on top of renesas-devel-v3.12-20131119.

Changes compared to v2:

- Fixed I2C MSTP clocks parents (hp -> p)
- Added Z and Z2 clocks
- Added r8a7791 clocks to DT

Changes compared to v1:

- The core CPG clocks driver now supports the r8a7791 SoC in addition to the
r8a7790. They are collectively refered to as 'R-Car Gen2'. The driver has thus
been renamed to clk-rcar-gen2.c. The DT bindings have been updated accordingly.
- Several MSTP clocks have been added to the r8a7790-clock.h header and a new
header has been added for the r8a7791
- The r8a7790 dtsi patches that add and reference clocks have been added to
this series.
