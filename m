Currently each driver, including SDHCI, does it on its own, the goal is to 
do this centrally. And yes, in our specific MMC case, if we want to 
support GPIO controllers with 1 cell, no mmc DT node, using GPIOs for WP 
or CD should be using the inversion flag - even where possible.

Sorry, don't understand. of_get_named_gpio() just returns a GPIO number, 
not GPIO level. It doesn't even actually request the GPIO for the specific 
user. Or do you mean, that gpio_chip::of_xlate() should request the chip 
to invert the GPIO from now on?

Right, not sure about that flag. Isn't it used for SDHCI-native WP?

Hm, that'd be a weird way to configure the pin, perhaps.

The mmc.txt document specifies cd-inverted and wp-inverted _explicitly_ 
for use with GPIOs. If we want to use them with built-in CD and WP pins, 
we have to modify those definitions too.
