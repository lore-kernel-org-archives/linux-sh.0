So you would prefer that I fold this portion into a patch later in the series?

That's very nice! I am happy to hear that. Is that patch targeting v3.10?

Excellent! I believe the easiest is to leave it as-is for now and have
a clean-up series that can be merged late in the cycle after your
patch is in. I am not sure if that fits with your way of dealing with
the pull requests. At least that's how we used to do it for SH. If you
have any suggestion when to remove it please let me know.

Thanks for this suggestion. Right now we call shmobile_timer_init()
that includes these calls:
	arch_timer_of_register();
	arch_timer_sched_clock_init();

For SH and mach-shmobile we have our own timers in drivers/clocksource
as platform regular devices. They export clock source and clock event
interfaces. Today we simply use the regular driver model together with
SoC code to register platform devices during SoC setup - this
including timers but excluding the arch timer.

I agree we need to find some way to make them work together with the
ARM architected timer.

Thanks,
