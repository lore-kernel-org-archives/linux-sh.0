Hi Simon and Laurent,

Thanks for the patch and the comments. I agree with Laurent that this
patch series isn't complete without that patch, but at the same time I
agree with Simon about current state. =) So I propose that this patch
should be merged later on - in say half a year or so.

Perhaps we should aim that the kernel used for the LTSI after
LTSI-3.10 should include this fix?

Another activity we need to deal with in the future is to depreciate
the non-multiplatform board support. It's probably good to hear from
the ARM SoC guys what kind of schedule they have in mind for the
common ARM architecture bits.

Cheers,
