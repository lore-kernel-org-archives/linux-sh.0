Subject: [PATCH] ARM: shmobile: r8a7779: Add L2 cache-controller node

Add the missing L2 cache-controller node, and link the CPU nodes to it.

The L2 cache is an ARM L2C-310 (r3p2), of size 1 MB (64 KiB x 16 ways).

Based on work for the r8a7740 by Geert Uytterhoeven.

* About the r8a7778 (M1A)

  My reading of the documentation is that although a pl310 L2 cache
  controller is present it is not available for use as there is no L2
  cache memory present. For this reason I do not intend to follow up
  with a similar patch for the r8a7798.

* Lightly tested against renesas-devel-20151124-v4.4-rc2
