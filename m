I believe that this is to allow discontinuous register ranges and the order
is not important.

The way I understand this is that intsrc* is used to register the
vectors associated with an interrupt source and in doing so allow
a phandle to be associated with the interrupt source.

So perhaps the following would be better?

- intsrc*               : Interrupt source.
                          Associate an interrupt source with its vector.

- *_registers           : These describe the vector table, mask, priority, ack,
                          and sense registers. It must contain the following:

 -- intc_vectors: This requires the vector_table property which is a list of
                  interrupt sources.

 -- intc_mask_registers        : This specifies the contents of the mask register.
    This node requires the following properties:
      * address-cells : Must be 1.
      * size-cells    : Must be 1.

> Are #address-cells and #size-cells not inherited from the parent node?

This seems to result in much unhappiness.

For example:

# dtc -v
Version: DTC 1.3.0
# make dtbs
...
DTC     arch/arm/boot/dts/sh7372-mackerel-reference.dtb
Warning (reg_format): "reg" property in /soc/interrupt-controller@0/intc_mask_registers/intc_mask0 has invalid length (16 bytes) (#address-cells = 2, #size-cells = 1)
...

How about this?

         ** reg         : This specifies the address of mask registers.
                          The first entry specifies the mask register and
                          the second entry specifies the mask clear
                          register.  The first cell is the register's
                          address, and the second cell is the register's size
                          which must be 1, 2 or 4 bytes.

How about this?

         ** reginfo     : This specifies the interrupt sources controlled by
			  the mask. The list entries correspond to bits of

Thanks, actually, I believe that the code already treats any absent entries
as zero. Is this documentation along the lines of what you had in mind?

         ** reg         : This specifies the address of the priority register.
                          The first entry specifies the priority set
                          register and the second entry specifies priority
                          clear register.  The first cell is the register's
                          address, and the second cell is the register's
                          size which must be 1, 2 or 4 bytes.  If there is
                          not priority clear register then they entry may
                          be omitted or 0 used as the register's address.

                          A group contains the priority for a single
                          interrupt vector. Thus a 16 bit register with
                          a field-width of 4 may control the priority for
                          4 (16 / 4) interrupt sources.

                          the priority register. The list entries
                          correspond to the groups of the priority register
                          from least to most significant.  A value of 0 may
                          be used for unused groups.  Trailing list entries
                          may be omitted in which case they will be treated

         ** reg         : This specifies the address of the sense register.
                          The first cell is the register's address, and the
                          second cell is the register's size which must be

They aren't required.

I have removed the example entirely as there is another example below.

- intc_group*           : Interrupt Source Group.
                          Interrupt sources may be grouped with a group
                          sharing the same bits of an interrupt priority
                          register.
  This node requires the following properties:
        * group         : This specifies the interrupt sources that
                          belong to the group.
