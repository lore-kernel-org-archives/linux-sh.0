Hi Olof, Hi Arnd,

please consider these Renesas ARM based SoC defconfig updates for v3.12.


In relation to adding a new defconfig I would like to note that Magnus and
I are aware of your ongoing requests to reduce the number of shmobile
defconfigs and that we are making progress on that front in two ways:

* Two boards, and their defconfigs were scheduled for removal in v3.11
  and a further two boards and their defconfigs are scheduled for removal
  in v3.12.

  For reference the boards are: ap5evb, bonito, ag5evm and kota2

* More importantly, we are making significant progress towards being
  able to use multiplatform and thus consolidate most if not all
  of the shmobile defconfigs into either a single shmobile defconfig
  or a more generic ARM defconfig.

  The removal of the boards mentioned above helps this process
  by removing the need to update as much code. In particular code
  which we have limited or no access to hardware to test.

  The main remaining barrier here is common clocks which I current
  expect to take a few more release cycles to get in order.
