Yes, right, I should have said "they are related";) How about calling the 
header mipi_display.h? This would then unite DSI, DCS, DBI and DPI? 
Creating a separate header for each of these standards seems like an 
overkill to me. We could then put MIPI CSI and CPI standards in an 
include/media/mipi_camera.h. Not sure where to put various other MIPI 
standards, I guess, we'll have to think about it as a need arises.

Ok, how about "telegram types" then?

This seems to be subjective;) But I'm not religious about it, and since 
Nokia (C) is the first in this file I might as well just accept your 
proposal;)

As others voted for unnamed enums, how about using them?

Concerning omap2 display drivers, AFAICS the only thing we want to change 
there is to switch them too to using the common header and telegram type 
and command names? So far I don't see a need for a generic MIPI (display) 
subsystem in the kernel with an own bus type, API etc. We could of course 
create a simpe bus with callbacks for sending short and long packets and 
reading data back, but do we really need it ATM?
