In response to a request from Olof renesas-dt-pm-for-v3.20 has been
withdrawn and the patches split between the soc-for-v3.20 and dt-for-v3.20
branches. I am assuming that the patches that 1-4 depend on are
now all in the soc-for-v3.20 branch. Could you check?

FWIW, I have squashed that patch into the patch that adds the problem
and the result is in the soc-for-v3.20. I will to push that result
a little later today.

This may be awkward to get into v3.20 unless we can adopt a looser approach
to the dependencies.

To that end I suggest that it could be queued up in the branch that has the
multiplatform work (a) but not the memory controller work (b) as the latter
seems to more naturally fit into the dt branch. What I am hoping that such
an approach would lead to code that compiles and boots in both branches.
And that new functionality becomes available when the branched are combined
(e.g. in v3.20-rcX).

If this is not possible then I can merge the pre-requisites and put
patch 5 on top. But I feel that the ARM SoC maintainers would prefer
that I didn't do that unless it is absolutely necessary.

In case you are wondering: branch gymnastics are not my favourite pass time :^)

>   3. Patch 6 (drivers/sh) depends on all of the above.

That part is clear enough :)

My intention here is to send a pull request to Linus for this change
once all the other patches have hit his tree. With a bit of luck that
would be around v3.20-rc2.
