Thanks, I'm happy to make that change if you think it is worth it.
(I will need to re-test on AG5, which I could do this afternoon
 if it is free)

Are you proposing changing tmio_mmc_enable_dma() to take
a struct platform_device * as its first argument?

tmio_mmc_enable_dma() is already altered in one of the
patches in this series to use sd_ctrl_write16() without
altering the arguments taht tmio_mmc_enable_dma() takes.

static void tmio_mmc_enable_dma(struct tmio_mmc_host *host, bool enable)
{
#if defined(CONFIG_SUPERH) || defined(CONFIG_ARCH_SHMOBILE)
	/* Switch DMA mode on or off - SuperH specific? */
	sd_ctrl_write16(host, enable ? 2 : 0, CTL_DMA_ENABLE);
#endif
}
