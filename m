It looks like it slipped through the cracks :-/ Should I submit it as a fix 
for v3.16 or wait until v3.17 ?

I plan to work on that, but I'm not sure whether I'll be able to finish the 
work for v3.17, as I need to concentrate on a DMA engine driver right now, and 
will then need to finish the DT bindings for the IPMMU driver (which may 
result in fixes for some of the iommu_domain-related problems).
