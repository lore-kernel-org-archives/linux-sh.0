Thanks. Since you bring up the topic, I'd like you to queue up this
patch series more or less right away if possible. =)

About how to handle the dependencies, I am not sure if you intend to
keep the SoC bits separate from the PFC and the board code. It is
possible to split it out by series but if that is needed or not
depends on how the ARM SoC guys want to be fed.

Regardless, this r8a73a4 SoC V3 series depends on the following patch
to compile:
[PATCH/RFC] ARM: shmobile: Disallow PINCTRL without GPIOLIB

Laurent seems OK with the patch above, how about you? I am quite OK
with the above patch as a short term fix. But I believe Linus W and
Laurent at some point need to decide if it is valid to have PINCTL
selected without GPIO.

Thanks,
