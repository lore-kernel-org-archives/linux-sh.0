You are right.  I mistook the meaning of CONFIG_CRASH_DUMP.

If a user specified crash_kexec_post_notifiers option with kexec
being totally disabled, it just disables notifier and kmsg dumper calls
(please see PATCH 3/3). So as Daniel said, I also think it makes sense
to hide crash_kexec_post_notifiers option if kexec is disabled.
