For similar reasons as x86, can we please think about using:

	depends on ARM
	depends on ARCH_SHMOBILE || ARCH_SHMOBILE_MULTI || COMPILE_TEST

This way we don't end up polluting the configuration for non-shmobile
platforms.  Same goes for other ARM stuff... the number of options is
getting rather large and we need to think about keeping that in check
where its easily possible to do so.
