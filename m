    Has this been pulled by Olof/Arnd? If not, is it possible to amend 
this patch or should I send an incremental one? I forgot to update the 
platform device name from "sh-eth" to "r8a777x-ether" in the PinMux 
table, in accordance to the R8A7778 Ether device name fix. It would be
good if this got into 3.11 as otherwise Ether support on BOCK-W wouldn't 
work. I have discovered the mistake only yesterday.

WBR, Sergei
