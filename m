Subject: [PATCH 0/9] setting the table for integration of cpuidle with the scheduler

As everyone should know by now, we want to integrate the cpuidle
governor with the scheduler for a more efficient idling of CPUs.
In order to help the transition, this small patch series moves the
existing interaction with cpuidle from architecture code to generic
core code.  No functional change should have occurred yet.

The ARM, PPC, SH and X86 architectures are concerned.  Small cleanups
to ARM and ARM64 are also included. I don't know yet the best path for
those patches to get into mainline, but it is probably best if they
stay together. So ACKs from architecture maintainers would be greatly
appreciated.
