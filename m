Just looking into this, one user besides those two drivers is
pinconf-generic: pinconf_generic_dt_node_to_map() which is called from
 pinconf_generic_dt_node_to_map_pin() and
 pinconf_generic_dt_node_to_map_group()

And those would be a couple of more users. That's why I chose to not
change the behavior since this adds another 4 drivers to the list of
users that might depend on certain behavior.
