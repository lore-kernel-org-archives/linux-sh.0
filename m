There are several points to consider here.

- drivers/mmc/host/tmio_mmc_dma.c is only compiled in when CONFIG_MMC_SDHI is 
selected. The symbol currently depends on SUPERH || ARCH_SHMOBILE. We thus 
have no non-Renesas users for TMIO DMA at the moment.

- I don't know whether the CTL_DMA_ENABLE register is specific to Renesas or 
not. I haven't been able to find a publicly available copy of the TMIO 
documentation. The Renesas datasheets I have access to don't document the SDHI 
module. Can you comment on that ?

- Merely adding CONFIG_ARCH_SHMOBILE_MULTI to the CTL_DMA_ENABLE write #if 
guard will break on multiplatform kernels anyway. If a non-Renesas platform 
uses TMIO DMA, a kernel that supports both a Renesas SoC and that non-Renesas 
platform will have the CTL_DMA_ENABLE code compiled in.

For those reasons I have decided to remove the #if and defer the fix (if 
needed, if CTL_DMA_ENGINE is indeed Renesas-specific) to the first non-Renesas 
TMIO DMA user.

No, it isn't :-) I could try to find time to fix that later, but I don't like 
adding support for features that are not used. I would first want to be sure 
that the CTL_DMA_ENABLE register is indeed Renesas-specific, which might be a 
bit hard to ascertain of no non-Renesas chip implements TMIO DMA :-)
