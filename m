I think there is no need to go that far. Just providing a defconfig for
all boards that can already run a common image would be a good step
forward.

Is there a technical reason why you cannot build sh7367 together with
the ARMv7 based machines? Most other platforms that have both ARMv6 and
ARMv7 just build them together, you just can't combine them with any
ARMv4/v5 platform.
