Thanks for your patch series!

I gave this series (on top of "[PATCH v2 0/9] PM / Domains: Generic OF-based
support", with one minor conflict) a quick run on r8a7791/koelsch-reference,
r8a7740/armadillo-legacy, and r8a7740/armadillo-multiplatform.
Everything looks fine.

In personal conversations with technical people, I call myself a hacker. But
when I'm talking to journalists I just say "programmer" or something like that.
