Except that on most embedded SoCs, the term power domain has specific
meaning in hardware, so using something other than that is preferred
IMO.

What this really is is just per-device dev_pm_ops, which platform code
can use to group devices however it likes.

So rather than call it a power domain, or a PM domain, we could also
just add a struct dev_pm_ops to struct device.
