The problem is that the 'sd-uhs-sdr50' property is interpreted by the
MMC core, so I think it will start trying to use this mode even if the
driver hasn't implemented the necessary operations.  I don't see any way
around that.

The regression is relatively minor as I think the MMC core will fall
back to a lower speed after failing to enable SDR50.  But it will slow
down probing of a card.
