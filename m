Yes, I'm hoping to put them in v3.15.  I assume these actually
fix something, e.g., we need these changes to boot with new devicetrees, or
something?

The changelogs don't make it clear that these are fixes, and I want to heed
Linus' guidance: "Anyway, because -rc1 is already pretty darn big, I do
*not* want to hear about 'sorry this missed the window, can I still sneak
in'.  Fixes only."

I should have applied these sooner to make the merge window; I apologize
for that.  Anyway, if you outline what these fix, I'll update the
changelogs in my tree.

Bjorn
