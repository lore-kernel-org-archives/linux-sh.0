That's potentially unsafe, as we haven't touched any of the IRQ
controllers at that point - we can't guarantee what state they'd be
in.  Given that the default FIQ is to just return, a FIQ being raised
at that point will end up with an infinite loop re-entering the FIQ
handler.

FTTC broadband for 0.8mile line: 5.8Mbps down 500kbps up.  Estimation
in database were 13.1 to 19Mbit for a good line, about 7.5+ for a bad.
Estimate before purchase was "up to 13.2Mbit".
