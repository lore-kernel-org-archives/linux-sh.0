Subject: serial core: crash / race condition on unbind

When unbinding a serial driver, uart_remove_one_port() clears
uart_state.uart_port:

        state->uart_port = NULL;

If the serial port is still in use (e.g. by getty), uart_close() will be
called later:

        static void uart_close(struct tty_struct *tty, struct file *filp)
        {
                struct uart_state *state = tty->driver_data;
                struct uart_port *uport;

                ...

                if (!state)
                        return;

                uport = state->uart_port;

uport is NULL

                ...

                pr_debug("uart_close(%d) called\n", uport->line);

If debugging is enabled, it will already crash here while dereferencing uport
(this one is easily fixed)

                if (tty_port_close_start(port, tty, filp) = 0)
                        return;

                ...

                uart_flush_buffer(tty);

uart_flush_buffer() will try to obtain the port's spinlock:

        static void uart_flush_buffer(struct tty_struct *tty)
        {
                struct uart_state *state = tty->driver_data;
                struct uart_port *port;

                ...

                port = state->uart_port;

port is NULL

                ...

                spin_lock_irqsave(&port->lock, flags);

Crash!!

It doesn't always crash, though.

Sometimes uart_close() returns after the tty_port_close_start() above,
without a crash (bypassing e.g. the call to uart_change_pm() :-(
Sometimes it crashs in uart_chars_in_buffer(), which also tries to take the
spinlock:
    tty_port_close_start()
        tty_wait_until_sent_from_close()
            tty_wait_until_sent()
                tty_chars_in_buffer()
                    uart_chars_in_buffer()
                        spin_lock_irqsave(&state->uart_port->lock, flags);

I'm not that familiar with the internals of the serial core. Perhaps
uart_close()
should return early if uport is NULL, just like if state is NULL?
However, that means the uart_change_pm(state, UART_PM_STATE_OFF)
is bypassed again.

This is with sh-sci, but I don't think the driver matters.

Thanks for your comments and suggestions!
