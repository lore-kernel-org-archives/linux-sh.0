I'm not entirely sure that gets used (or even created).
kmalloc_index(152) returns 8 (INDEX_NODE=8) since KMALLOC_MIN_SIZE=128
and the "kmalloc-node" cache size is 256.

This means that the first kmalloc cache to be created, "kmalloc-128", is
off slab.

slab_early_init is cleared after "kmem_cache" and "kmalloc-node" caches
are successfully created. Following this, the minimum kmalloc allocation
goes off-slab when KMALLOC_MIN_SIZE = 128.

When trying to create "kmalloc-128" (via create_kmalloc_caches(),
slab_early_init is already 0), __kmem_cache_create() requires an
allocation of 32 bytes (freelist_size) which has index 7, hence exactly
the kmalloc_caches[7] we are trying to create.

The simplest option would be to make sure that off slab isn't allowed
for caches of KMALLOC_MIN_SIZE or smaller, with the drawback that not
only "kmalloc-128" but any other such caches will be on slab.

I think a better option would be to first check that there is a
kmalloc_caches[] entry for freelist_size before deciding to go off-slab.
See below:

Subject: [PATCH] mm: slab: Avoid BUG when KMALLOC_MIN_SIZE = (PAGE_SIZE >> 5)

The slab allocator, following commit 8fc9cf420b36 ("slab: make more slab
management structure off the slab"), tries to place slab management
off-slab when the object size is PAGE_SIZE >> 5 or larger. On arm64 with
KMALLOC_MIN_SIZE = L1_CACHE_BYTES = 128, "kmalloc-128" is the smallest
cache to be created after slab_early_init = 0. The current
__kmem_cache_create() implementation aims to place the management
structure off-slab. However, the kmalloc_slab(freelist_size) has not
been populated yet, triggering a bug on !cachep->freelist_cache.

This patch addresses the problem by keeping the management structure
on-slab if the corresponding kmalloc_caches[] is not populated yet.
