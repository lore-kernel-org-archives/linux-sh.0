Thank you for the v3 patch.
I tested this, and kernel log said "GP_5_19 already requested".
However, the hsusb on lager uses GP_5_18. Is this correct behavior?

sh-pfc e6060000.pfc: pin GP_5_19 already requested by ee090000.pci; cannot claim for e6590000.usb
sh-pfc e6060000.pfc: pin-179 (e6590000.usb) status -22
sh-pfc e6060000.pfc: could not request pin 179 (GP_5_19) from group usb0_ovc_vbus  on device sh-pfc

Best regards,
