I'm not sure about the regulator case, but it's been useful to support
passing NULL around in the clock framework case. There are plenty of
cases where a struct clk is optional and if we fail to find the clock we
just set clk to NULL and continue on without having to constantly check
the value of the clk pointer, which helps considerably when you consider
the number of clk_enable/disable() pairs some drivers have.

Presumably the same applies for regulators?
