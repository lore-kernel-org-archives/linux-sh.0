I will do my best. But I need to have pull-requests sent off
to the arm-soc maintainers before rc6 appears. And ideally patches
should have been present in next for a day before I send such a request.
So by my calculations I need to push things to my next tree very
soon (i.e. today) in order to reach the above mentioned criteria.
