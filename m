I guess we give up with the idea of unifying the API then, because it is
proving to be impossible to come to any kind of concensus.  Even ideas
to solve the points of contention are argued against.

I see no one else coming up with any practical ideas how to resolve this,
but what I do see is that attempts to provide a solution to allow progress
towards a unified API are shot down with great vigour.

So from what I can see it's a complete waste of time discussing this any
further.

Unified clock API?  It'll *never* happen.
