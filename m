Uhm, apparently ap4evb_defconfig is broken so I don' t think so.

I cooked up the following fix against renesas-next-20130613:

[PATCH] ARM: shmobile: sh7372 build fix for SUSPEND=n && CPU_IDLE=n

In the future, can you make sure the board is working and we're
migrating towards DT? If so we can keep the board.

Thanks,
