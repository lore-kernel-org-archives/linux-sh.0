After some further thought I have reasoned that:

1. It is only a one line change on the shmobile side
2. It is to a file that is not seeing much chainge and in
   a block of code that is seeing even less change.

And thus the chance of a conflict is small.

With this in mind I will ack the shmobile patch.
