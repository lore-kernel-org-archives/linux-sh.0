It is still used as a "memory source" by Dave Anderson's crash utility for 
live examination of a running system. Redhat has "overcome" the /dev/mem 
deficiencies by writing an out-of-tree re-implementation of /dev/mem, which 
uses /dev/crash instead. As it is an "unnecessary duplication of an existing 
driver", this method was rejected by the project manager here at SUSE.

The suggested alternative was to enhance (or fix) the existing driver. Without 
this patch series there is no way to access high memory. In conjunction with 
CONFIG_HIGHPTE, it makes the crash utility near to useless on anything with 
high memory, because crash can no longer translate virtual to physical 
addresses.

Well, there's one (quite unimportant) distro that doesn't compile with 
CONFIG_STRICT_DEVMEM: openSUSE (and SLES, consequently).

See above - live crash sessions on i586 (or any other arch that has high 
memory).

Let me put it differently. Do you think that an out-of-tree duplicated effort 
(the crash.ko module) offered by Redhat is somehow superior to enhancing the 
in-tree /dev/mem driver?
