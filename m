Well, I'm not sure if we know in advance what's going to happen to the device
right after a system-wide resume.  It may be a totally different situation from
the device activity point of view.

As a matter of fact, this need not be true at all.  For example, consider a
wireless network adapter that was assosicated with specific access point
before a system-wide suspend, but this access point is not present any more
after the subsequent system-wide resume.

I really don't think we can predict what's going to happen to a device after
a system-wide resume, so IMO we should assume that the device will be necessary
immediately after the resume and we should resume it.  It still can autosuspend
normally afterwards if it's not needed after all.

I'm not sure if this is doable so easily for PCI devices, for one example.
Most probably, they will come up in D0 after the system-wide suspend and
the PCI resume code will have to suspend them directly so that they remain
"autosuspended" after the resume.

Well, yes and no.  Namely, if we freeze the workqueue, all of the bus types
using it will have to check the vaildity of operations carried out by it,
because of the possibility that system-wide power transition took place in the
meantime and changed the state of the device.  Also, please take the PCI
example into consideration.

Hmm.  Can you please describe a theoretical situation in which this kind
of autoresume request will appear?  I'm not really sure what you mean here. :-)

This is a difficult problem in general.  I _think_ we should ignore such
autoresume requests for devices that are not marked as wake-up ones
and we should abort the suspend if there's a request from a wake-up device.

I think they should abort the suspend unless it's too late (eg. the suspend
sequence has reached sysdev_suspend()).

Anyway, below is a prototype implementation of a generic runtime PM workqueue,
just for discussion.

pm_schedule_suspend() and pm_schedule_resume() are to be called by bus types
that are requesting the autosuspend or autoresume, respectively, of a device.
The supposed control flow is like this:
* bus type calls pm_schedule_suspend() to schedule autosuspend of a device
* at the right time the PM workqueue executes the bus type's ->autosuspend()
  callback which is responsible for calling the device driver to suspend the
  device (the way in which this is done is totally bus type-specific)
* if there's a resume event for the device, it's delivered to the bus type
  driver (in a bus type-specific way) and the bus type schedules autoresume of
  the device by calling pm_schedule_resume()
* the PM workqueue executes the bus type's ->autoresume() as soon as it can
  and this callback is responsible for calling the device driver to resume the
  device (the way in which this is done is totally bus type-specific).

Thanks,
Rafael
