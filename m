	Hi Simon, Magnus,

This patch series adds the missing L2 cache-controller nodes to the
DTSes for various Renesas ARM-based SoCs, and links the CPU nodes to
them.

For R-Mobile APE6 (r8a73a4), the L2 cache-controllers are also linked to
the respective (already existing) SYSC Power Domains. Fortunately these
Power Domains were never powered down, as they are parents of the Power
Domains containing CPU cores. This may change in the future.

For R-Car Gen2 and Gen3 (r8a779x), this serves as a preparatory step for
adding SYSC Power Domain support later.

Question for the ARM/DT people: What are the DT bindings for
Cortex-A15/A7/A57/A53 L2 cache controllers?
Everybody just seems to use "cache" for the compatible values...

Patches 2-5 were extracted from series "[PATCH/RFC 00/15]
ARM: shmobile: R-Car: Add SYSC PM Domain DT Support",
(http://lists.infradead.org/pipermail/linux-arm-kernel/2015-June/348742.html)
and received some fixes. You can find more detailed changelogs in the
individual patches).

This has been tested on r8a73a4/ape6evm, r8a7791/koelsch, and
r8a7795/salvator-x.

Thanks!

In personal conversations with technical people, I call myself a hacker. But
when I'm talking to journalists I just say "programmer" or something like that.
