Depends.  There is a limit to how long you may be willing to wait after 
people.  Sometimes the only way to make progress is to merge the thing 
and hope that someone who cares will test the stuff during the ~2 months 
-rc period and provide any fix then.  And if that doesn't happen during 
that time then either the code is just right and no one noticed the 
change, or no one cares anymore.

IMHO, Rob posted those patches many times now for quite a while (many 
months) already.  So I'd suggest simply pushing that stuff into mainline 
as is.
