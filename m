Hi,

I think we're getting closer. I re-organized the series to illustrate
the dependencies better instead of my development process. The
respective patches have some more details and also changelog.

The first three patches essentially extend pinconf-generic by:
 - properly support and distinguish between the 'groups' and 'pins' DT
   properties
 - option for drivers to use the pinconf-generic infrastructure with the
   generic + driver-specific DT parameters

Doing so, resulted in one change in the API. I fixed up all the
call-sites I found, I hope.

The last four patches are the platform specific stuff. The actual
driver, DT update, documentation, etc.
The DT binding have been revised another time to conform better with how
the generic parameters are defined.

Since the Zynq-specific parts rely on the pinconf-generic changes, I
keep the audience to pinctrl stakeholders. Once there is an agreement on
those patches I will post the Zynq patches on the relevant lists.

	Thanks,
	Soren
