Thank you very much for your review!

I got it.

I will add a new WAIT state.

Your point is correct.

I got it, I will modify this.

In the previous code, the driver always enables the "Automatic CMD12 Issuance"
function in the multi-block case. So, we don't need wait for read- and write-end
conditions. However, if we use SBC, we disables the "Automatic CMD12 Issuance"
function. So, we have to do this only when we use SBC.

So, Should I separate this code as other patch?
Or, should I remove this code, and add similar code to sh_mmcif_end_cmd() and
sh_mmcif_[mread,mwrite]_block()?

Since we have to set the "data->bytes_xfered" below, we need to enter this path
even if we use SBC:

>>  		if (!mrq->cmd->error && data && !data->error)

We need this code.

I will remove it.
