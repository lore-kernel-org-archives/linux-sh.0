It's not about that. I mean proprietary in the sense that the register
layout is not based on some open spec and is customised to some
particular usage, not that it is evil, anti-GPL and "sekrit". I have
worked on embedded products which have custom FPGAs for _very_ dedicated
usage. The FPGA firmware is company IP and therefore not open (which is
nothing to do with Linux). The types of products I'm talking about are
often very niche market and dedicate use and therefore not a case of
vendors screwing over the general public. Writing the drivers in
user-space makes development easier; it's not an attempt to hide code
from the public. There is nothing to stop a /dev/mem userspace driver
from being open, just as there is nothing to stop a kernel driver for a
closed platform under Linux being "closed".
