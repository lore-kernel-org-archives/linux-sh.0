I'm not sure what you're talking about.  What exactly was wrong with the
original CC list in particular?

Do you know how exactly it breaks that?  If so, care to share that knowledge?

However, this is a regression fix, so I'd prefer to fix the problem on top of
it instead of reverting this commit entirely.

Well, dropping the commit altogether and dropping the "CC stable" tag are
equally disruptive at this point, so I think I'll just defer all of the
cpufreq fixes I wanted to push for 3.12 before the ending of the merge
window.
