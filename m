Subject: [PATCH/RFC 0/3] implement HDMI clock rate optimization

This is an attempt to further improve HDMI quality on sh-mobile by 
optimizing clock rates. Currently on ap4evb PLLC2 is used as HDMI clock 
parent, clocked at 594MHz, which provides exact 74.25MHz, required for 
720p, when divided through 8. However, for other video modes other parent 
clock frequencies can provide better precision for the HDMI clock. This 
patch adds necessary platform callbacks to reconfigure the parent clock 
and implements this optimization for ap4evb.

Thanks
Guennadi
