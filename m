Actually it should have been static, it should only be used in 
fb_edid_add_monspecs(). But if we move it to modedb.c, then it certainly 
becomes global, but still doesn't have to be exported, modedb.c and 
fbmon.c are always linked together. As for CONFIG_FB_MODE_HELPERS - yes, 
it is already under it in fbmon.c. But well, yes, in the future these CEA 
modes can be used by other code paths, so, moving it to modedb.c might be 
more logical, yes, but I wouldn't export it.

Thanks
