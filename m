Hi,

I have some comments on the devicetree binding.

Typically compatible strings use '-' rather than '_'.

I'm not quite sure what "Set already 1" means. Perhaps these should say "Must be 1" ?

This confused me, but I see it's a standard property. It's probably worth
noting why it's required, e.g. "ranges	: empty as we have a 1-1 mapping to
parent's address space".

Presumably these registers are not identical, and the order is important. This
order should be specified.

I'm not sure what this means. If this has a well-defined meaning for the
device, it may be worth having a link to some additional documentation from the
binding doc.

Are #address-cells and #size-cells not inherited from the parent node?

Saying "address size" here is very confusing, as it sounds like you're
re-inventing the #address-cells property. I assume you mean the register size? If so
just say the size must be 1, 2, or 4 bytes.

Also, s/sell/cell/

Which devices?

If there is not a priority clear register, why not only describe the priority
set register?

The absence of a second set of reg cells will tell you it's not present, and
will be easier to spot when reading the dts.

What does this specify? The number of intc_group nodes?

If so, can this not be omitted and calculated by counting intc_group nodes?

These 0s at the end of the reginfo property, why are they required? They were
not described in the rest of the binding documentation.
