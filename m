Yes, no problem. This seemed like a low-hanging fruit initially but has
turned into something much bigger now.

Instead of attacking all these at ones, we can leave them as something
worthwhile doing later. I noticed that out of the 11 shmobile defconfigs,
only three (marzen, kzm9d and kzm9g) actually have a nonzero MEMORY_START.

Maybe it's possible to consolidate all or some of the others first, since
they should still work with the same uImage at the expense of just making
the early debugging a little harder, as we discussed earlier.

For all I know, these three boards are also the ones seeing the most
ongoing development, so you could start by using a shared defconfig
for the oldest (ARM11 based) boards at first that are also less likely
to impact new development starting from the defconfig.
