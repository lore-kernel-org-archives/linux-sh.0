I don't understand why you want to have a KZM9D board file at all,
since it from looking at it, I can find nothing that is truely
board specific and doesn't already have bindings. This is different
from the other boards that you just converted to DT_MACHINE_START
but still left using individual board files because some bindings
are missing.

The only board specific device you add for KZM9D is smsc911x, and
that has bindings, all the other devices can just be hardcoded
for the soc because they are always the same, until we have bindings
for all of them. Am I missing something?

The preferred way would be to store the dtb on the same medium that
contains the kernel, so you can update them together if necessary,
even though we try to keep dtb files compatible across kernel versions.
I would not want to rely on a hardcoded dtb file in the boot loader.
