I'm deferring these for now because they depend on Liviu's work, which I
haven't merged yet, and I suspect some minor adaptation will be required
here.

For what it's worth, I agree with Rob's hesitation about mixing lookup with
domain number allocation in of_pci_get_domain_nr().  That seems
unnecessarily complicated.
