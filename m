The biggest difference is that the stuff Ian is working with is a
full-blown MFD, while from our side we're simply dealing with an insular
MFD cell. At the moment we have a shim single-function MFD driver
(sh_mobile_shdi) that simply packages up the insular cell and binds it to
tmio-mmc so that we could keep using the same interface on the MMC side
without having to hack up the driver irreperably.

The behaviour however is not always the same, which you can already see
in things like 311f3ac76826bfd8ed6213ded91ec947df164def when DMA support
was added. For the most part it's been posible to keep things fairly
compartmentalized by layering on top of MFD, but there are plenty of
cases where we just have to make assumptions about how the other versions
of the block work. Given that we don't have an MFD in any of the blocks
we're using, it's not always readily apparent what the best way to split
things out is while keeping within the spirit of the MFD layering. How
best to handle runtime PM for example remains an outstanding issue.

As far as I can tell, all of the other MFD drivers using tmio-mmc are
already years old and mostly seem to have come out of the handhelds.org
work. Some of them bear recent copyrights but were ported from 2.4 code,
and so date from that era of hardware. I expect that for the most part
these have all been end of lifed from Toshiba's side already, so it's not
entirely obvious how easy they will be to procure. I'll take a look and
see what I can dig up though, and of course we're happy to send hardware
with our version of the block in it to whoever wishes to do independent
testing.
