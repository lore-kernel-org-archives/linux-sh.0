I've added linux-arm-kernel to the list to get a wider view from
people who actively use the clock subsystem.

At the moment, the code to actually use the support is sitting in
drivers/sh and gets initialised if it is built. This is the source
of the original confusions.

I think it would be ok if drivers could /opt out/ if the bus clock
handling was done like this for all platforms and we simply noted
that the pm code is doing it. At that point it would be nice just
to build the code in drivers/base/power unconditionally.

At the moment we could quite easily enable this code for all the
ARM platforms as the clk framework should deal nicely with properly
balanced clk_enable() and clk_disable() calls.

Enabling it across the board would also remove any issues with
changes in platform behaviour and find any bugs sooner rather than
later.
