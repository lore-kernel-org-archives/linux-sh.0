Not in principle, but I think there is.  Namely, if there are two groups
of devices belonging to the same bus type (e.g. platform) that each require
different PM handling, it is legitimate to call them "power domains" (where
"domain" means "a set of devices related to each other because of the way
they need to be handled"), even if they don't share power resources.

Of course, if they do share power resources, the term is just right. :-)

Thanks,
Rafael
