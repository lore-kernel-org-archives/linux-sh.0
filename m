Hi,

this series is a follow-up to "[PATCH 00/16] SCIF, I2C and FSI pinctrl
functions for sh73a0" by Laurent Pinchart. I am primarily posting it for
his review.

This series differs from the v1.1 series posted by me earlier today in
that it depends on the following update to the kzm9g reference code.

* ARM: shmobile: parse DT and configure pinmux early on kzm9g-reference

This series differs from the (v1) series posted by Laurent in the following
ways:

* Due to some slightly over-zelous git use on my part the series
  is actually based on a checkout of
  git://linuxtv.org/pinchartl/fbdev.git pinmux-pfc-funcs

  As such it includes several patches not included in the series posted in
  via eimal as the series "[PATCH 00/16] SCIF, I2C and FSI pinctrl
  functions for sh73a0". In particular it includes r8a7740 and r8a7779
  patches.

* I have added the following two patches to update the KZM9G rerence code.

  ARM: shmobile: kzm9g: reference: Register pinctrl mappings for I2C
  ARM: shmobile: kzm9g: reference: Register pinctrl mappings for SCIF


This series is based on :

        git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/horms/renesas.git topic/pinmux-pinctrl

Which is in turn based on the following branch which
includes the kzm9g reference code.

        git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/horms/renesas.git topic/pinmux-base

Laurent, if you want to change this series in any way just let me know.
I can drop patches individually or drop the entire series and add a fresh
one from you to the topic branch.

Git and diffstat information is provided below to aid review.
