Hi Russell,

The aim is to allow JTAG scripts to be used in-place.
The script is constructed from ASM macros which are defined
in arch/arm/mach-shmobile/include/mach/zboot_macros.h which is
included later on in the patch. The same macros exist in SH assembly
in arch/sh/include/asm/romimage-macros.h.

With regards to the license, I have confirmed that it is GPL.
Would you be more comfortable if that was stated explicitly
in the new files?
