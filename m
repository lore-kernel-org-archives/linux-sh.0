You mean HRX1, HTX1, and HSCIF1?

HTX1 and HRX1 can be connected to the DEBUG1 transceiver by stuffing
zero-Ohm resisters to R834 and R835.

About your comment about the resistors and capacitors, which applies to
both HSCIF0 and HSCIF1: probably the serial port will still work if
these are present.

Nevertheless, I agree with Laurent.

HSCIF1 (and HSCIF0) cannot be used on the Koelsch board as-is, hence they
should not be present in the plain Koelsch DTS.  They should be put in
an overlay
DTS instead.
