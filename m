If fine with keeping the board if someone can show me progress in the
area of INTC DT support. Recently I have not seen anything.

So if no one is developing DT support for this board then I can't
really see how we will be able to support it in the future with ARM
SoC requirements for DT and MULTIPLATFORM...
