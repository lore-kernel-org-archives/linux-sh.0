I think that's a decision to make by the (successor of the) ePAPR committee.
At least it would be nice to get some feedback from the DT review team
about this.

If we go that road, the vendor-specific compatible value should still be
documented, else checkpatch will complain when encountering it in a DTS.
Then, should it become

    compatible = "renesas,bsc-sh73a0", "renesas,bsc", "simple-pm-bus",
"simple-bus";

or should "simple-bus" just be added to of_default_bus_match_table[], so we
can drop "simple-bus" from the list in the DTS:

    compatible = "renesas,bsc-sh73a0", "renesas,bsc", "simple-pm-bus";

So far not many users or other interested parties chimed in, so that's
still to be seen. If/when this happens, we can remove the vendor-specific
matching from the driver, and add a quirk, to add a "simple-pm-bus"
compatible value where needed, to platform code, right?

Thanks!
