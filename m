Olof didn't scream, so I guess he's comfortable with it? :-)
Olof?

If the propagation part is an issue, what about Simon applying it to a separate
branch, to be merged into both soc-for-v3.17 and boards-for-v3.17?

Indeed. And it touches arch/arm/mach-shmobile only.

It seems you forgot r7s72100.h, r8a73a4.h, and sh73a0.h?
Can just be moved, with #include update.

Remaining are lots of files only used by arch/arm/boot, so I'd move those
(mmc*, sdhi*, zboot*) into .../boot.

mach/system.h seems to be unused?

The parts of irqs.h needed for legacy pinctrl can be extracted into
drivers/pinctrl/sh-pfc/irqs_legacy.h, to be removed later.
After that irqs.h can move, too.

After that, we can see what's left...
