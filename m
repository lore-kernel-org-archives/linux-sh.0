	Hi Simon, Magnus,

The following patch series completes r8a7790 SoC and Lager board
integration for the Renesas Quad Serial Peripheral Interface. It brings
r8a7790/Lager to the same support level as r8a7791/Koelsch, allowing access
to the Spansion s25fl512s SPI FLASH for both legacy and multi-platform
kernels.

    [1/7] pinctrl: sh-pfc: r8a7790: Add QSPI pin groups
    [2/7] ARM: shmobile: lager legacy: Add QSPI pinmux
    [3/7] ARM: shmobile: r8a7790 dtsi: Add QSPI node
    [4/7] ARM: shmobile: lager dts: Add QSPI nodes
    [5/7] ARM: shmobile: lager defconfig: Enable RSPI and MTD_M25P80
    [6/7] ARM: shmobile: lager legacy: Enable Quad SPI transfers for the SPI
	  FLASH
    [7/7] ARM: shmobile: lager dts: Enable Quad SPI transfers for the SPI
         FLASH

Please do _not_ apply patches [6/7] and [7/7] yet, as these have a runtime
dependency on Quad SPI support in the RSPI/QSPI driver, which is queued up
in the linux-spi tree for v3.15.

Thanks!

Gr{oetje,eeting}s,
