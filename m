Subject: [PATCH v2 00/29] Add OF support to the sh-sci serial port driver

Hello,

This is the second version of the patch set adds device tree bindings for the
sh sci serial port devices and adds OF parsing to the sh-sci driver.

The bindings are based on Bastian Hecht's proposal (see
http://www.spinics.net/lists/arm-kernel/msg228129.html). The approach taken
here is more minimalistic: instead of describing all hardware characteristics
that vary between the SCI device revisions in DT (such as registers layout),
that information is stored in the driver and selected based on the compatible
property value. Only SCI revisions used on ARM devices are supported through
DT, as DT support for SuperH is nowhere down the line.

Patches 01/29 to 06/29 clean up the sh-sci driver. Patches 07/29 to 27/29
replace memory and interrupt resources passed through platform data with
platform resources. Beside replacing a custom mechanism with a standard one,
it will also make the DT parsing code simpler as resource allocation will be
shared between DT and non-DT code paths. Finally, patches 28/29 to 29/29 add
OF parsing to the sh-sci driver and create DT bindings documentation.

The patches have been test on a Lager board (r8a7790-based). Support for other
SoCs will be added as needed. Note that all current Renesas ARM SoCs seem to
be compatible with the generic (H)SCI(F)(AB) devices, but the plan is for
their DT bindings to list the SoC-specific version in case incompatibilities
are found later.

Patch 08/29 ("serial: sh-sci: Support resources passed through platform
resources") is the only dependency of the arch/arm and arch/sh patches present
in this series. As it's too late to get it in v3.13, Simon will need a stable
branch of the linux serial tree with that patch included.

Changes compared to v1:

- Patches 04/29 to 27/29 have been added
- Multi-interrupt support has been removed from the DT bindings as they don't
  support any SoC requiring multi-interrupt yet
