The purpose of this email is to offer a quick status update which
I hope will bring this matter to a close.

I have submitted and queued up a patch as per 1. above.

With regards to item 2. above: I have also followed up on the "HSUSB uses
mp_clk for USB-DMAC access" comment in the original changelog (above).
Mizuguchi-san has confirmed that statement is not correct and its presence
in the changelog was an error.
