Yep, good.

It was pretty obvious once I tried applying them and building that
they did indeed resolve the build errors. However, the reason I'm
asking for a better description is that when looking at just the pull
request, or even the patch full commit description, it was impossible
to tell why the patch was urgent as a fix. So, while I am not
questioning that the patch should be included, I'm just requesting to
make sure it's properly described. That's also good for historical
purposes when someone is reading the git logs a year from now, etc.
