In code. I don't think it is workable to embed runtime PM behaviour
into the DT bindings. I think there will be too much variance in what
hardware requires. We can create helpers to make this simpler, but I
don't think it is a good idea to set it up automatically without any
control from the driver itself.

I would say in device drivers.

I need to look at the series before I comment. I've flagged it and
will hopefully look at it tomorrow.
