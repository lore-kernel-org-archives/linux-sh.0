Yes, so to fulfil the requirement that printk needs to call clk_enable 
from atomic contexts, document that clk_enable can not sleep.  Or add 
the clk_enable_atomic call and modify printk to use it.

My bad, it should have said "clk_enable_atomic".

Won't that cause a lot of code duplication?  If it's possible to have 
one sane implementation, why not go for it at once?
