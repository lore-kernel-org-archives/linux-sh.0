AUXDATA seems to be a great way to add a platform data pointer as a
workaround while implementing DT support, but when it comes to
translate the name based on base address the code becomes very
verbose.

I am all for going with the simplest half-way solution that uses the
least amount of lines of code, but I doubt it can get any simpler than
a single line of CLKDEV_DEV_ID().

Thanks,
