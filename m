Hmm, I wonder if this is possible in general. A lot of the GPIO bindings
allow passing flags, but I think that some of them do not, for historic
reasons. If we want to deprecate the behavior in eMMC, we should also
ensure that all gpio drivers are extended to support gpio specifiers
with flags. It should be possible to extend all drivers in a compatible
way, but someone has to do that.

When we introduced the MMC binding, the situation was already like this,
and it seemed easier to leave the {wp,cd}-inverted properties as optional.
