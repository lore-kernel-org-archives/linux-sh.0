In light of all the recent "add fallback compatibility strings" patch series
from Simon, perhaps I should reconsider, and just match against three (new)
family-specific compatible values:

    "renesas,scif-rcar-gen1"
    "renesas,scif-rcar-gen2"
    "renesas,scif-rcar-gen3"

instead of the 8 (and more coming) SoC-specific compatible values?

Following that scheme means we will have to add many compatible values
to the existing dtsis. I.e. every SCIx device node (there are more than 100)
will have 3, like

        scif0: serial@e6e60000 {
                compatible = "renesas,scif-r8a7791", "renesas,scif-rcar-gen2",
                              "renesas,scif";

Not having the SoC-specific ones in the driver won't cause an issue when using
an old DTS with a new kernel: you can't use the new BRG features without
adding the extra clocks to the DTS anyway, so you can add the family-specific
compatible value when doing that update.

Simon, what do you think?
