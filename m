	Hi Simon, Magnus,

This patch series replaces the "arm,cortex-a15-gic" compatible value for
the GIC device node by "arm,gic-400" in the R-Mobile APE6 and R-Car Gen2
device trees:
  - The R-Mobile APE6 documentation states it has a GIC-400,
  - The R-Car Gen2 is assumed to have a GIC-400, too.

The presence of a GIC-400 has been confirmed on APE6 and R-Car M2 by
reading the GICD_IIDR register[1], which reports 0x0200043b (GIC-400 0x02, ARM = 0x43b).

This change has no effect on runtime behavior, as currently[2] the GIC
driver treats both compatible values the same.

This has been tested on r8a73a4/ape6evm and r8a7791/koelsch.

Thanks for applying!
