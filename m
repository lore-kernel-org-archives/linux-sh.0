I don't understand what's going on here.

For one thing, this sounds like a workaround for an R-Car hardware
defect.  ASPM is supposed to be an autonomous, hardware-based
mechanism (spec sec 5.10), so software shouldn't need to be involved
in the transitions.  Bugs are a fact of life, so it's not a problem to
have workarounds, but if it *is* a hardware erratum, it would help the
reader to mention that in a comment.

Beyond that, I'm confused about how this really does any good.  It
looks like you'd have this scenario:

  - downstream device wants to enter L1, so it sends PM_ENTER_L1 DLLP
    upstream to host controller

  - host controller can't enter L1 by itself

  - ... some arbitrary time elapses ...

  - driver performs config access to downstream device

  - rcar_pcie_config_access() notices downstream device wants to enter
    L1, so it helps host controller transition link from L0 to L1

  - rcar_pcie_config_access() issues config access

  - config access causes link to transition from L1 to L0

So it seems like the link would only be in L1 for the tiny amount of
time between your write of L1_INIT and the actual config access.  I
must be missing something.
