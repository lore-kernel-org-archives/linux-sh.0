It already is linked:

        bsc: bus@fec10000 {
                compatible = "renesas,bsc-r8a73a4", "renesas,bsc",
                    "simple-pm-bus";
                #address-cells = <1>;
                #size-cells = <1>;
               ranges = <0 0 0 0x20000000>;
               reg = <0 0xfec10000 0 0x400>;
                clocks = <&zb_clk>;
               power-domains = <&pd_c4>;
        };

        https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/arch/arm/boot/dts/r8a73a4.dtsi#n446

But without this hack in clk-mstp, the clock domain controller doesn't know
it can use this clock for power management like an ordinary mstp clock.

Gr{oetje,eeting}s,
