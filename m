Indeed. "select" is evil, and has a devastating effect on minimal
defconfigs (lots of churn and nasty surprises like the one you mentioned).

So it actually makes more sense to derive multi_v7_defconfig
from the individual platform's defconfigs.
I also have a script for that, which I wrote to create m68k's multi_defconfig
a long time ago:
https://github.com/geertu/linux-scripts/blob/master/linux-config-merge

In the long run, I think creating defconfigs from DTS is the way to go.
Extracting dependencies from the build system (both Makefile and
the myriad of complex dependencies in Kconfig) are the biggest hurdles to
solve.
