Yep.

Broadcast? Like a bus clock? For that we also have properties with phandles...

Syscon is the Hot New Abstraction for a module that provides a bunch of
registers needed by drivers for other modules. Those other modules need
some way to refer to the appropriate syscon register.

The RST module definitely falls in that category: CPG needs the MODEMR
register, watchdog (RWDT/SWDT) needs the Watchdog Timer Reset Control Register,
and APMU probably needs the CA15/7 reset control registers.

Gr{oetje,eeting}s,
