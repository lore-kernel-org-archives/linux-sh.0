Sorry for surprising you with that merge-order requirement.

Unfortunately I am not comfortable with taking patch 1 for v4.3 because:
1. Its now very late in the cycle
2. There now seems to be some discussion around it.

I think I am happy to take the other patches for v4.4, now. But perhaps
I should wait for the discussion around patch 1 to conclude first?
