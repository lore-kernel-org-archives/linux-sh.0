I think it would be better to s/l2cc/l2x0/, and to make it clear that
the document only applies to the variants listed above.

If ePAPR doesn't cover the other cases, we should document those
separately.

With the other properties from ePAPR you can acquire information on the
geometry of the cache, which cannot be acquired from architected
registers.

Thanks,
