	Hi Simon, Magnus,

This series contains prototype patches to improve pm domain support for
r8a7740/armadillo800eva, mimicking (parts of) the existing pm domain support
for sh7372/mackerel.

More specifically, they
  - Add missing devices to existing pm domains,
  - Add missing pm domains, hooking up devices and subdomains,

There are a few things commented out, and a few rough edges or missing things
(cfr. the patches marked with "[WIP]", and the "FIXME" sections therein),
but the result does boot, and s2ram works.

Please note that DT/multi-platform support will be added later.

This series depends on my series "[PATCH 0/5] ARM: shmobile: pm domain
improvements and cleanups".

Thanks for your comments and suggestions!
