Clocks are under control of drivers. Drivers are supposed to
use the clock framework to enable the clocks they use. The fclk-enable
is just a work around to enable driver-less IP and similar.

So, if your FPGA part has proper drivers, you should add the appropriate
description in DT and the drivers would need to use the CCF to enable
the clocks. Otherwise you can work around this by specifying
fclk-enable.
