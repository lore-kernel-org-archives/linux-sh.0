	Hi Simon, Magnus,

This series improves PM domain support for r8a7740/armadillo800eva legacy,
mimicking (parts of) the existing PM domain support for sh7372/mackerel.

More specifically, it
  - Adds missing devices to existing PM domains,
  - Adds missing PM domains, hooking up devices and subdomains.

This series is based on renesas-devel-20141016-v3.17, but working resume from
s2ram depends on a fix for sh_mobile_hdmi which is only in v3.18-rc1.

Changes in v3:
  - Keep D4 PM domain powered, until the ARM debug/perf code uses resource
    management with runtime PM support.

Changes in v2:
  - Dropped FIXMes on behavior that turned out to be expected,
  - Hook up the HDMI-Link hardware block,
  - Really add the A4MP and D4 PM domains, as fixes are available,
  - Move special CPU domain handling from A4S to A3SM.

Please apply, after merging in v3.18-rc1.

Thanks!
