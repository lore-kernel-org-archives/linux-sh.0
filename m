I prefer you to use a hardware-block version compatible suffix instead
of SoC suffix.

This since we have more SoCs than actual hardware block
configurations. Using the list above, how many configurations would we
have?

Actually, forcing the drivers to be updated for each new SoC sounds
like a pretty terrible idea. Wouldn't that be against one of the
merits of using DT? Also, don't you have enough interesting work piled
up already? =)

Basically, I can't see any point in adding an extra unnecessary need
for updating the drivers when there is no real functional change.
