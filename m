Yep, that's also my target.

Right.

Well, that's easy - we just put lcdc(0) after pcdc1 in the device list in 
board-ap4evb.c.

Don't know about the console, I used gstreamer with "fbdevsink 
device=/dev/fb1" sink.

Well, why - that's clear - no fish;) The reason is, that I'm saving power 
as long as no display is connected, and for that I use "fb_set_suspend()." 
I think, we want to keep it this way, right? I can relatively easily 
extend the driver to check-and-wait for a plugged in and turned on monitor 
at startup. At the moment I first initialise HDMI, it enables interrupts, 
receives a hotplug interrupt, starts reading EDID and enables EDID done 
interrupt. While waiting for that interrupt, the framebuffer begins its 
initialisation, tries to turn the display on, using the "platform" 
callback, the HDMI driver sees, that the display is not yet recognised, 
sets the "suspended" flag in framebuffer info. At the end of probing the 
LCDC driver checks that flag (or that's what it should do anyway), and if 
set, turns its own clock off and runtime-suspends itself. I can try to 
eliminate this first suspend / resume cycle for the case, when you probe 
with the monitor already turned on. But if you turn it on later, or if you 
turn it off and on later again - the penguin will be gone anyway, similar 
to if you switch ttys.

Good, thanks
