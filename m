Why would you think that it risks an abuse ? It does not create new semantics
of allocation in the buddy. Its just uses existing GFP_KERNEL allocation which
is then getting zeroed out. The risks (if any) is exactly same as GFP_KERNEL.

Does that mean GFP_PGTABLE can be created but not in gfp.h but in some other
memory related header file ?

IIUC from the allocation perspective GFP_ACCOUNT is the only thing which gets
added with GFP_PGTABLE for user page table for memcg accounting purpose. There
does not seem to be any other differences unless I am missing something.
