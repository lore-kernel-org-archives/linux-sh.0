Ok, I looked at this code, there's now a comment in simple_tx_submit():

	if (power_up) {
		...
	} else {
		/*
		 * Tell .device_issue_pending() not to run the queue, interrupts
		 * will do it anyway
		 */
		schan->pm_state = DMA_SIMPLE_PM_PENDING;
	}

And that's exactly what should be happening: an interrupt should trigger 
the IRQ thread should call simple_chan_xfer_ld_queue(), so, looks like the 
interrupt is not coming? It's also strange, why and how it worked without 
dma-simple? I don't think I changed that with the transition... 
Investigating.

Thanks
