(+cc Grant Likely)

imaplen does indeed get initialized to 32 (size of interrupt-map /
sizeof(u32)) but its printed above after its been decremented in the
loop which is misleading
(http://lxr.missinglinkelectronics.com/linux/drivers/of/irq.c#L201)

The issue appears to me to be a bug in of_irq_parse_raw() which has
been around since Graht's original commit:
http://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/drivers/of/irq.c?id}c2e1134a22dc242175d5321c0c9e97d16eb87b

                        pr_debug(" -> imaplen=%d\n", imaplen);
                }

The issue is that the interrupt-map table point (imap) needs to be
incremented over the parent unit interrupt specifier which is
newintsize cells, not newaddrsize + newintsize cells.  The invalid
calculation would cause the pointer to get mis-aligned and thus only
the first interrupt entry would ever get properly checked for a match.

It looks like of_irq_parse_raw() is only called from
of_irq_parse_pci() which prior to Lucas' patch was only called from
pci_read_irq_line() called from pcibios_setup_device() used in
arch/arm/powerpc, so perhaps this function isn't widely used
explaining why the bug was never caught.

I'll post a patch shortly with the above fix.

right - this is shifted because of the issue above.

With the above patch Lucas' original patch now operates correctly to
resolve the 4 legacy PCI interrupts required when using a P2P bridge
on the IMX6.
