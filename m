I don't see the point, either. The bitmap routines take the maximum size
of the bitmap as an argument, and so code that uses the API heavily and
has the size defined in a macro is going to have it sprinkled around, who
cares?

Wrapping up the bitmap API in your own wrappers to hide this fact only
makes it more confusing and really doesn't buy you anything. While things
like sh_keysc_map_set/clear() might seem obvious enough, it's also
impossible to tell whether these employ __set_bit()/__clear_bit() or
set_bit()/clear_bit() semantics without having to scroll back and look
them up. The added obfuscation to save yourself from having to sprinkle
SH_KEYSC_MAXKEYS around simply isn't worth it.

Any time you start out wrapping an existing API for private driver use
outside of things like I/O accessors, you're almost certainly going to
run in to trouble.
