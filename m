Subject: [PATCH v6 00/12] CCF support for Renesas r7s72100

This series moves the r7s72100 platfrom from the legacy clock implementation to
the common clock framework.

This series has been tested with the renesas-devel-v3.15-rc2-20140428 tag. If
you want to boot into a console, you have a runtime dependency [1] which is
expected to go away in 3.15-rc6.

Changes since V5:

* rebased and tested against latest renesas/devel-tag
  (with and without CCF)
* added acks
* added the patch from Geert, and folded another into the series

PS: A tree can be found here with this series and the dependency patch:
