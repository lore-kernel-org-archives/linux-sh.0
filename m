There's another reasone for having a separate driver: if both the SH core and
the ARM core are in use, the second register bank can only be accessed after
acquiring the HPB (Peripheral Bus Bridge) semaphore.
While we don't actively support running anything on the SH core, we don't
want to prevent users from doing that.

when I'm talking to journalists I just say "programmer" or something like that.
