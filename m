First of all I think your example calls for more than one compatible
string - if it seems that soc,v2 is almost like soc,v1, make it
compatible = "soc-v2", "soc-v1" and don't touch the driver (as in: keep
it compatible with "soc-v1" only). Then, when the realisation comes, you
can simply add the "soc-v2" of_device_id with .data pointing at new
features.

Now the other thing - do you have a driver for a SoC at all? What I mean
is that in most cases it's the components/peripherals/IPs (whatever you
call them) matter, not the SoC itself, so the SoC compatible value can
be unique if you wish (and, if it is a *.dtsi, it will be compatbile
with "simple-bus" anyway ;-). Then the IP nodes can follow the rule
above.

Hope it makes some sense?
