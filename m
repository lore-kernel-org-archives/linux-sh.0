Great! Russell are you okay with taking the above as a fix or would you prefer
I fixup drivers/of/fdt.c right now? 


Thanks,

Subject: [PATCH] arm: Bring back early_init_dt_add_memory_arch

Commit 1c2f87c (ARM: 8025/1: Get rid of meminfo) removed
early_init_dt_add_memory_arch in favor of using the common method.
The common method does not currently check for memory outside of
32-bit bounds which may lead to memory being incorrectly added to
the system. Bring back early_init_dt_add_memory_arch for now until
the generic function can be fixed up.
