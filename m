Good, thanks!

Yes, indeed, that's also what's suggested in the clock bindings 
documentation, thanks for pointing out.

Well, I've been thinking about this today. I think, bridge drivers will 
call centrally provided helper functions to enumerate links inside ports. 
While doing that they will want to differentiate between links to external 
devices with explicit configuration, and links to internal devices, whose 
configuration drivers might be able to figure out themselves. How should a 
driver find out what device this link is pointing to? Should it follow the 
"remote" phandle and then check the "compatible" property? The word 
"immutable" is a hint, that this is a link to an internal device, but it 
might either be unneeded or be transformed into something more 
informative.

Right.
