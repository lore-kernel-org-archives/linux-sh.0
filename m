PM: SuperH Runtime PM prototype V2

[PATCH 01/04] sh: SuperH platform bus code for Runtime PM v11
[PATCH 02/04] i2c: Runtime PM changes for SuperH I2C driver 
[PATCH 03/04] uio: Runtime PM changes for UIO driver
[PATCH 04/04] video: Runtime PM hack for SuperH LCDC driver

This series is the Runtime PM prototype for SuperH V2. Included
is a architecture specific Runtime PM implementation prototype
for the platform bus together with a few driver changes.

The patches are meant to be applied on top of the following: 
"PM: Introduce core framework for run-time PM of I/O devices (rev. 11)"
"PM: Runtime PM v11 - add dev_pm_ops helpers"
"PM: Runtime PM v11 - let bus-less devices succeed"
"PM: Runtime PM v11 - add debug printouts"
"PM: Runtime PM v11 - CONFIG_PM_SLEEP=n support"
"Driver Core: Runtime PM callbacks for the Platform Bus V2"

For the SuperH side of things you also need latest sh-2.6 git and:
"Driver Core: Add platform device arch data V3"
"sh: Runtime PM pdev hwblk changes"

Patch 01 + 04 need more attention
Patch 02 + 03 should be all that is needed for Runtime PM driver support.

Rafael, please have a look at the Runtime PM v11 issue in patch 04.
