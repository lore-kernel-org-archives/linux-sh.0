Hi Lars, Simon

I tested these 3 patches on armadillo800eva

	[PATCH v2 1/3] ARM: shmobile: armadillo800eva: Properly specify HDMI audio link format
	[PATCH v2 2/3] ASoC: sh: fsi: Fix clock inversion
	[PATCH v2 3/3] ASoC: simple-card: Remove support for setting differing DAI formats

Tested-by: Kuninori Morimoto <kuninori.morimoto.gx@renesas.com>

2/3 patch changed behavior for clock inversion on FSI driver.
FSI + wm8978 on armadillo800eva worked without any issues,
but, I don't know how much effect it has for other board.
We used this inversion flags on each board for historical reasons (copy-paste),
but, almost all these were not needed (except some picky board) on FSI.
Maybe Lars's 2/3 patch is correct, but, it is difficult to check/confirm for all boards.
And unfortunately, Renesas don't use FSI anymore.
So, I think keeping current FSI driver as-is is more safety for old boards.
armadillo800eva works well with below patch (as 2/3 patch)
