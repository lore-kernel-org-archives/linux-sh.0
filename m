Thanks, I have used the modified scheme that you describe above and all
seems well. In detail, I have done the following:

Patches 1 - 7: sh-soc based on v3.8-rc1
Patches 8 - 21: pfc, based on sh-soc
Patches 22 - 29: soc (ARM SoC), based on pfc
Patches 30 - 42: sh-soc2, based on pfc
Patches 43 - 50 and 55 - 66: pfc2, based on a merge of soc and sh-soc2
Patches 51 - 54: soc2 (ARM SoC), based on pfc2
Patches 67 - 78: sh-soc3, based on pfc2
Patches 79 - 81: pfc4, based on a merge of soc2 and sh-soc-3

Assuming that nothing nasty crops I plan to push the result to
the renesas tree later today.
