We are talking about only one symbol here, which symbol is also 
dependent on the way this feature is implemented in gcc (e.g. on x86 the 
implementation is totally different and this symbol isn't used).  So I 
don't see a huge gain by defining this symbol in generic code, given the 
number of lines involved in the addition of a new file, just for a 
single symbol.

Not exactly.  gcc will reference __stack_chk_fail which incidentally is 
already defined in kernel/panic.c for everyone to use.  But 
__stack_chk_guard is not universally used on all architectures.

Would you care to elaborate?

See above.
