It'd be nice to switch shmobile to use AUTO_ZRELADDR, as it is
the other criteria (apart from common clock) standing in the way
for multiplatform. (Maybe this just works if you turn it on?)

For multiplatform you also have to depopulate <mach/*>
completely, either move stuff down into the mach-folder
or to <linux/platform_data/*> if absolutely necessary.
This will be quite some work, especially if the <mach/*>
path is used in a lot of drivers...

Then we have a quite broad consensus to depopulate arch/arm/*
of drivers, so for shmobile:

clock* -> drivers/clk
cpuidle.c -> drivers/cpuidle (or was this just fixed?)
intc* -> drivers/irqchips
sh-gpio.c -> drivers/pinctrl/gpio

The last one I know you will soon finish.

Then deleteing all board file stuff that is not using DT.

After all that it's top-notch I think :-)

Yours,
Linus Walleij
