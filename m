Pulled into next/soc as well. One detail I noticed for the first time is
that the setup-*.c file hides the machine descriptor inside of #ifdef
CONFIG_USE_OF, which makes no sense since the file is only compiled
when ARCH_MULTIPLATFORM is set, and that does 'select USE_OF'.
It would be better not to add that #ifdef for new files, and you
could perhaps remove the existing ones after the conversion to
multiplatform is complete.

Thanks,
