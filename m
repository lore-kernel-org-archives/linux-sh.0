Hi Geert,

thanks for taking care of this, is quite a task!

At this point I see two ways to move things forwards:

1. Greg can consider taking this series and I can take the
   related integration (DTS) series (noted below) into v4.6.
2. I can get some missing Acks from Greg (patches 02 and 07 I believe)
   and try and queue up this series and the related integration (DTS)
   series (noted below).

As it (perhaps surprisingly) it is late in the merge cycle for me to take
changes for v4.5 that will go though the ARM SoC tree and I am trying to
stabilise things a little. Thus, I favour option 1.
