Yes, transaction looks good to me.

Yes, I'd use u8 too, because the specs define "transaction types" to take 
6 bits and "DCS commands" to be 8-bit ints. But, you know, doesn't our 
case fall under case (b) of Chapter 5 "Typedefs" of CodingStyle?:) I mean, 
wouldn't it make sense to create two typedefs for these to add some 
type-safety? In fact, transaction types cannot be user-defined / 
proprietary, right? So, for that an enum would work. It's only DCS 
commands that allow extensions. But making transaction type an enum and 
command a typedef would be ugly, and making a typedef for an enum is 
frowned upon too...

But you only need specific panel drivers if you want to support their 
proprietary commands? Otherwise you only need a set of parameters - 
timeing requirements etc. - which you can perfectly just pass in platform 
data?
