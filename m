The trouble is not with the drivers, is the fact there could be a clock
tree where, say the closest to the driver is easy to control but the
base of the tree may be a PLL which requires time to settle.

Now, there's a lot of work in the 'embedded' space where the focus is on
the power consumption, so powering down PLLs when they are not needed is
a good thing to have/

I really don't like the fact that people are doing these things in
atomic contexts, and I think we should apply some pressure to move
the atomic caller cases to use systems where they can sleep such as
using threaded-irq handlers (they work very nicely)
