Since each and every patch applies cleanly and things work well both
before and after, let's have each maintainer that is active apply
their own. If there are platforms that don't have a significant number
of patches, i.e. if they're not collecting a branch, then we can apply
those. Please follow up with us with the stragglers, I'll assume the
rest will come in through the respective maintainers.
