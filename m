	Hi Simon, Magnus,

This patch series migrates the DT-based generic r8a7740 platform and
the armadillo legacy platform from calling l2x0_of_init() to the
generic l2c OF initialization.

Changes in v2:
  - Fix interrupt reference in DT,
  - Describe L2 better in DT,
  - Keep only {,~}L2C_AUX_CTRL_SHARED_OVERRIDE in
    machine_desc.l2c_aux_{val,mask}, as there's no DT property for
    this.
  - Add L1 cache to DT.

Dependencies:
  - The first patch depends on r8a7740 DT PM Domain support (tag
    renesas-dt2-for-v3.20 in Simon's repository),
  - Although there are separate patches for dtsi, SoC code, and board code,
    there are dependencies among the individual patches:
      - patches 2, 3, and 5 depend on patch 1,
      - patch 4 depends on patches 2 and 3 (and thus 1).

Note that this conversion should be done on sh73a0, r8a7778, and r8a7779,
too.

This was tested on armadillo-legacy and armadillo-multiplatform.

Thanks!
