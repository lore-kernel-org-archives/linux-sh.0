Thanks.

Actually the FIFO Control Register doesn't say anything regarding automatic
control, but 16.4.2 Operation in Asynchronous Mode, Section (3) Transmitting and
Receiving Data gives examples of operation when "modem control is enabled".

Those examples show autoRTS/autoCTS behavior.

Anything that enables the gpios which will be in DT and beyond our control
needs to exclude autoRTS/autoCTS within the patch that provides the
DT functionality.

Right. And I'm saying that a condition of gpio-based RTS/CTS support needs to
contain the logic that prevents autoRTS/autoCTS, and not rely on orthogonal knobs.

I see that but crucial support for CRTSCTS is missing, AFAICT; namely,
a modem status interrupt.

There's no way to determine when the remote re-enables CTS without polling,
and the serial core provides no mechanism for the driver to poll CTS.

So again, the driver has no way to trigger stopping/restarting tx when CTS
changes without autoCTS. (A modem status interrupt for dCTS should call
uart_handle_cts_change() to perform this operation).

Not the way I read the TRM: 16.3.11 Serial Port Register, bit 7 states
"When the RTS pin is actually used as a port outputting
the RTSDT bit value, the MCE bit in SCFCR should be
cleared to 0."

IOW, autoRTS/autoCTS needs to be disabled to get the RTS override value
outputting at the pin.

Since there is no userspace knob for autoRTS, drivers that enable autoRTS
with CRTSCTS should force RTS to inactive for set_mctrl(!TIOCM_RTS) and cause
RTS to return to normal operation (autoRTS, if enabled, or RTS active otherwise)
for set_mctrl(TIOCM_RTS).
