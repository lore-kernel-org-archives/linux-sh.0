So, looking at this branch, I think you need to reorganize your patches a bit.
You seem to have fallen back to the case of only sorting patches by what
Renesas SoC they are for, while they are clearly of different kinds such that
we would prefer to see them sorted differently for arm-soc.

For example, the fix from Arnd should go in a shared shmobile fixes branch,
ideally. Some of the DT initialization should maybe go in a separate
(shmobile-shared) DT branch. Clock, suspend/resume and other patches can go in
a shared SoC branch across all of shmobile though.

Care to respin? I had a handful of comments on the patches as well, and I'll
continue to look at some of the other ones.

Since you'll have to respin, we might as well see the reshuffling into shared
shmobile branches, so I'll drop the three merges I had already done of
SoC-specific branches. I'll follow up on the ones I claimed to have merged.
None had been pushed out anyway.
