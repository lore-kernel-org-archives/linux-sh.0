Double check that you have this commit present:
 ---------------
commit 8c69d7af12265e5be9326110b695e010b47505bd
Author: Stephen Warren <swarren@nvidia.com>
Date:   Fri Jul 5 22:59:42 2013 +0100

    ARM: 7780/1: add missing linker section markup to head-common.S
 ---------------

as I think you are reporting the same problem that it fixed.

Thanks,
Paul.
