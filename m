This one at least should go through Russell's tree. The dependencies from
my side will be sorted out early in the merge window, so you should be
able to submit this to Russell's patch tracker after that for a late -rc1
merge, or for -rc2. After that's done, there don't seem to be any more
outstanding dependencies, so at that point I'll be able to take care of
the remaining patches.
