Hi Arnd,

Thanks for your feedback, please see below for my reply.

Uhm, perhaps I misunderstand, but I wonder if you refer to INTC instead of IRQC?

This particular driver is for the IRQC hardware block. It is not
compatible with INTC. A while ago I posted an incremental DT support
patch for IRQC -  "[PATCH] irqchip: irqc: Add DT support", please see
https://lkml.org/lkml/2013/3/6/50

Thanks. I don't think the INTC patches went anywhere.

To zoom out a bit let me list different interrupt controllers:

A) INTC (drivers/sh/intc) [no DT yet]
B) GIC (drivers/irqchip/irq-gic.c) [DT]
C) INTC External IRQ Pin (drivers/irqchip/irq-renesas-intc-irqpin.c) [DT]
D) IRQC (drivers/irqchip/irq-renesas-irqc.c) [DT]

Simple use cases are:
- Legacy SH SoCs or ARM SoCs with Cortex-A8 or older make use of A).
- More recent ARM SoCs with Cortex-A9 or newer use B) and C) or B) and D).

On top of this we now and then have GPIO controllers that have
built-in interrupt controllers.

Hope this helps,
