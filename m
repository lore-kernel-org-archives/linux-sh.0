The _etext symbol is already used for that purpose.

Now we round it up to the next section mapping which might leave quite a 
lot of data content exposed in ROM.  But given it is more or less the 
same data present in RAM except for those bits that are modified at run 
time, I don't see what an attacker would gain from the data in ROM   
that cannot already be obtained from kernel RAM.  If the section mapping 
extends to part of the ROM that is no longer kernel data then maybe this 
would expose sensitive data.  Is that what you're worried about?
