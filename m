Thanks for your guidance, Russell. The right way to fix this now seems
pretty clear to me.

Are you aware of any existing fix for this or anyone working on
solving this issue? If not then I don't mind stepping up. I can
however think of quite a few other things to do if this has been
solved already though, so please let me know if you think I should
focus on fixing this.

Cheers,
