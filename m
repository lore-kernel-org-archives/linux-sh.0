Hi,

Coming across this somewhat old email thread, apologies for the delay in
response.

We have definitely been OK with new code going in together with cleanups,
but I think we're reaching a point where there's a lot of new code going
in on shmobile platforms now, and we've had some growing pains on the
platform for it -- conflicts with other maintainer trees because they have
picked up board file changes, etc.

I think much of this wouldn't be a problem if the conversions to
DT/multiplatform was completed, so it would be great if the conversion
could be given priority on the Renesas side, especially given the rate
of new additions as of late -- I think we're seeing new SoCs almost
every release cycle as of late.

So, bottom line: I'm not going to refuse taking this new platform,
but you're close to the limits and please try to prioritize finishing
conversion.  In particular since all this "new legacy code" you're adding
will all have to be converted soon -- in some cases it might be better
to wait with adding it until after conversion.
