Hi Chris,

Sure. For your real embedded device, you want a small kernel, without any cruft.

Of course the range of SoCs that can run Linux now a days varies greatly, so I don't think you can put them all in the same category like ARCH_MULTIPLATFORM was trying to do.

ARCH_MULTIPLATFORM (the multi-platform part) was also introduced to reduce the
number of kernels you have to built. This matters not only for testing
(increasing build coverage while reducing the number of kernels vs. the number
of machines), but also for Linux distributions, who typically ship only a few
kernels, but want to support as many machine types as possible.

Now, to solve your problem: can you get it to work by dropping XIP_KERNEL's
dependency on !ARCH_MULTIPLATFORM in arch/arm/Kconfig?

Possibly.
