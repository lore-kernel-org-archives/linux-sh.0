Given that this doesn't do anything, I see no reason to leave this
machine based on ATAG rather than DT probing:

+MACHINE_START(KZM9D, "kzm9d")
+       .map_io         = emev2_map_io,
+       .init_early     = emev2_add_early_devices,
+       .nr_irqs        = NR_IRQS_LEGACY,
+       .init_irq       = emev2_init_irq,
+       .handle_irq     = gic_handle_irq,
+       .init_machine   = emev2_add_standard_devices,
+       .timer          = &shmobile_timer,
+MACHINE_END

Just make this DT_MACHINE_START and add a minimal .dts file for
it that has the right compatible value. That will already enable
people to add devices in their .dts files without touching
the platform code.

It would also be really easy to just add DT support for the three
devices you actually support (GIC, STI, uart), because two of
them already have bindings and the third one is a new driver.
When we discussed this new soc earlier, you said that using DT
based booting would be extra work, but given the set of devices
that you are putting into this, I don't think that argument holds
any more.
