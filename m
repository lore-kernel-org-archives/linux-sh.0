This function handles 3 cases:

1. A regulator that can (in principle) change state, i.e., switch on and 
off. Such a regulator is good to keep for the runtime to power up and down 
the card.
2. A regulator, that cannot switch, but at least can tell its supplied 
voltage is used ones to read out supported voltages and released again.
3. A regulator that can do none of the above is defined as "useless"

So, a fixed voltage regulator is indeed a useful one - it can tell us the 
voltage and maybe even switch power. A dummy regulator can do none of the 
above.

Aha, you mean, I shouldn't put() the regulator, even if it cannot change 
status itself? Can this also happen with a dummy regulator?

Hm, sure, I can add some comments:-)
