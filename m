Sounds good. You could also leave out the sh_mobile_sdhi part from
3) patch to avoid the conflict, and add a comment in that place
as part of 2), to say that the slave_id assignment can be removed
once the other parts are done. That way, we know where we're at
if we want to remove slave_id from dma_slave_config and it's still
part of the sdhi driver.
