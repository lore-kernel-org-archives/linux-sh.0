Hi Russell,

Just because ioremap on memory mapped by the kernel is just plain not permitted
I have proposed a new pair of functions: dma_reserve_coherent_memory()/dma_free_reserved_memory()

http://lkml.org/lkml/2010/8/19/200

but it is not quite well accepted from the community.
What is your opinion?

Thanks,

Marin Mitov
