Hurrah! Thanks for giving it a spin.

Yes. Currently [i.e. on my branch above] you can do SMP kexec using the CPU
hotplug platform_cpu_kill callback to take down the CPUs in some
platform-specific manner.

The more difficult case is when you want to offline the secondary CPUs into
a pen and then boot them in the new kernel. I did get some of this working,
but there are outstanding issues with whether the pen should be at a fixed
location or not. If not, then we need a way to tell the new kernel where it
is, which may involve updating the DT blob...
