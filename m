Thanks for listing these. I agree that we need time to make the bindings stable.

Right, I can see how it is possible to end up in that situation by not
supporting all device hardware features in the driver from the
beginning and just "enabling" DT support. It does however seem to me
that in such case the DT binding must have been written to match the
driver and not the hardware. We should try not to. =)

So perhaps we would need more time to develop the initial DT binding
for the particular device version? Of course if this happens then we
need to fix it - no doubt about that - but exactly how to fix it needs
to be discussed and handled case-by-case IMO. Having plenty of
stabilization time (and users) will help here I think.

So if the documentation gets a surprise update then we should of
course update the software too. Depending on how long time the DT
binding has been in use I believe we have different options how to
handle backwards compatibility. We can ignore the DT stability
altogether or make sure to keep compatibility for some time. Exactly
what to do depends on the timing, number of users and difficulty of
maintaining compatibility and our users in the particular product
segment. Stabilization time should help here too.

This one is a bit different IMO.

While I agree that vendors should submit their DT bindings upstream as
first step I would not necessarily use the word "experimental" for
such DT bindings. Instead I would argue that it is natural for the
vendors to cover only their own hardware to begin with. I would also
say that it is pretty normal for the kernel to over time come up with
better ways to describe the hardware.

My opinion is that it is seldom right to break DT compatibility just
because a slightly nicer common binding has been designed. Instead I
think it makes more sense to use the new-and-improved DT style for
newer SoCs and keep compatibility for older SoCs. Basically I believe
we should handle different SoC generations and their devices with
different style of bindings and keep on moving forward to better and
better ways to describe the hardware.

I don't think stabilization time would help in this case.

I agree about your suggestion about r8a7740 stabilization time.
Regarding the particular case with MSTP my opinion is that we must
have discussed this nesting option when we designed the MSTP DT
bindings in the first place. Of course, new information may have come
up so we need to adjust. I do however think that it must make sense to
handle r8a7740 and newer SoCs in the new DT binding format but refrain
from breaking existing MSTP DT bindings for already supported SoCs.

As you can tell, I don't think there is any one-way-fits-all for DT
stability. In the end I think this all is about keeping a good balance
between making a stable enough kernel for our users while also not
collecting too much compatibility cruft. One way to handle this is to
separate the timing for introduction and removal of DT bindings and
give users time to move over.
