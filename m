Hi Olof, Hi Kevin, Hi Arnd,

Please consider these Renesas ARM based SoC marzen board removal for v4.3.


This series removes legacy r8a7779 SoC and marzen board code.
It aims to do do so in a way that does not introduce feature regressions
when when booting the r8a7779/marzen board using shmobile_defconfig,
which provides for booting using multiplatform, a scenario which previously
used board code to provide some features including SMP.

Because of the above this series modifies SoC and DT files,
and then removes code. And because of that it was not entirely clear to
me which branch it should go into, so I have provided it in a stand-alone
branch.

Unfortunately this branch has a number of minor conflicts with the "Renesas
ARM Based SoC Cleanup for v4.3", tagged as renesas-cleanup-for-v4.3, which
you have previously pulled.

A resolution to those conflicts can be found in the
renesas-next-20150730-v4.2-rc1 tag of the renesas tree.

On a more positive note, I believe this to well over 8000 lines of legacy
code removed in this cycle :)


Changes between v1 and v2:

* As requested by Olof: Do not include defconfig updates;
  these will be handled separately
