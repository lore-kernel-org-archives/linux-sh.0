The clk_div_table for cpg_sd01_div_table[] concurs with the manual
but not with values found in the device itself (which are also the
same as the ones in arch/arm/mach-shmobile/clock-r8a7790.c).

Update the clk-rcar-gen2.c driver to have the same table as the one
used by the mach-shmobile driver which work once further issues are
fixed in the clk-rcar-gen2.c driver.

Part of the fix for the following error where the driver reports the
output as 1MHz but is really 97.5MHz:
    sh_mobile_sdhi ee100000.sd: mmc0 base at 0xee100000 clock rate 1 MHz
