Why? Why cannot we save some power between IO operations - if we can do 
this quickly and safely without affecting functionality and throughput?

Ok, there might well be such command sequences, but my question is: who 
knows about them? Is this mandated by the MMC(/SD/SDIO/...) standard or is 
it host-specific? Also "might mean" is actually interesting here. I think 
we eventually need a combination of timing-oriented PM constraints and 
"stateful" ones. During such a command sequence you would require the card 
clock to stay on.

As I said above, I think, we need both - to be able to require a certain 
responsiveness / throughput and specific interface parameters like 
supplying clock, power, etc.

Also notice, that setting a constraint doesn't affect in principle, when 
the device is allowed to suspend. This is done as usual per 
pm_runtime_get*() and _put*(). I think, a reasonable solution to use PM 
QoS to impose timing constraints but at the same time to not disable the 
hardware, when this is disallowed, is to tie pm_runtime_get() and _put() 
calls to driver's .set_ios() method, like tmio_mmc and sh_mmcif drivers 
currently do. Those drivers only call pm_runtime_put() when the interface 
clock is gated. So, as long as the core is aware, that that IO sequence 
has to run uninterrupted without stopping the clock between single 
transfers, it just has to avoid gating the clock for that period and the 
interface will not enter any power-saving mode.

So, I don't think we need to enforce pm_runtime_get_sync() in 
mmc_claim_host().
