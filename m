The mode bits of course influence the CPG (otherwise we wouldn't be having 
this discussion :-)), but to me it looks more like a configuration broadcast 
through the whole SoC than a real link between two IP cores. It's obviously 
subject to interpretation.

I'd go for a u32 as that's what all the vendors I came across use. It could 
easily be extended to a u64 or an array of u32/u64 later if needed. The format 
of the boot mode value will be SoC-specific, but that's also true of the mode 
register that would be read through syscon.
