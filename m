Looking back at the mail tread, I'd say there are people who have legitimate 
usecases. However, this may not be the most important question. At the moment, 
the /dev/mem interface is broken (it doesn't implement the specification 
correctly), and my patchset fixes it.

If there are no technical objections, I'd like to ask for an Acked-by from all 
involved people.

@Ingo: you can also send a patchset that rips off the /dev/mem driver 
completely if you believe that would get through. I'm completely fine with 
that, because then the /dev/crash driver will no longer be a semi-broken re-
implementation of an existing in-kernel driver, so I'll be able to post it as 
a new driver.

But please make a decision either way.
