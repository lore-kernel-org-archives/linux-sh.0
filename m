Like most of what you had to say. Although, I think Jeremy did a pretty=20
good job of trying to push things along in the right direction. So, I=20
wouldn't call this an utter failure. I hope you aren't confusing=20
Jeremy's patches with the additional patches that Sascha is adding on=20
top. I haven't looked much at Sascha's patch series -- so I can't=20
comment on them.

More comments follow.

Agree. I would very much like it.

Agree.

>     - a field for the current clock rate

Meh! Not a big deal. Some clocks don't have the concept of setting their=20
rate since they share a parent with another unrelated clock (Ah, looks=20
like you talk about with the tree diagram). So, it might be easier to=20
have the rate inside each implementation if they need it. I shouldn't=20
add too much code.

>     - a field for the base register

Definitely no. It's completely useless for clocks whose registers don't=20
all line up with fixed offsets from the base register. Now I will have=20
to put one register here and the rest of the registers in the internal data?

>     - a struct for the offsets of the most common registers relative to

Ok, you thought about rest of the registers. But, how can this fit in=20
the common code? Each clock h/w implementation has totally different set=20
of registers. Sometimes different even within the same SoC. This would=20
be quite wasteful and doesn't even make sense to store at the top level.=20
Also, storing offsets is a pain in the neck when the register space is=20
not clean (happens more often than we would like :-().

Again, I don't see the point in having this in the common code. May be=20
I'm missing something?

IMO, a better option instead of the base register and the offsets would=20
be an option to have a priv_data pointer. I forgot the exact use case,=20
but we thought that would have been helpful when we tried to port the=20
msm clock driver in our tree on top of Jeremy's patches.

This has nothing to do with the patches Jeremy made. clk_get()/_put() is=20
in clkdev. Also, I'm not sure if clk_get()/put() needs refcounting.=20
That's like asking kalloc/kfree to have refcounting.

Agree. That would be nice. I think the main reason people were not=20
pushing for it was to do things in manageable steps. It took a long time=20
for people to agree on even the current framework Jeremy added.

Ah! Nice to see that this bothers you too. This has been a point of=20
contention with in our internal team too. I keep pushing back on=20
requests to make child clock's set rate propagate up to the patent when=20
the parent has two unrelated child clocks going to different devices.

IMO, the set rate should only work on the parent clock and if there=20
really in a need to change the child clock rates, then the users of=20
those child clocks will have to co-ordinate it amongst themselves.=20
Although, our use case is a bit simpler in that most of the time the=20
child clocks are direct branches (no dividers) of the parent.

To handle, more complex cases like these, I think a
clk_set_divider(div)
and/or
clk_set_frac_mult(numerator, denominator)

might be an API that we should add. If a child clock cares only about a=20
ratio with the parent clock, clk_set_divider() is a much better API that=20
clk_set_rate(). And we have real use cases of for these in MSM.

At least in h/w I have seen so far, all the clocks that can really=20
change parents fall under one of these categories:
1. A clock with a mux for input from several PLLs running at fixed rates=20
(fixed at least after boot). So, these clocks can actually generate=20
frequencies that they can guarantee won't change from underneath.

2. Clocks with are a mux from a bunch of external inputs that's=20
completely end user/board defined.

For (1) the parent is really changed as part of "clk_set_rate()". For=20
(2) I think we should just let set_parent() control the mux.

I'm not sure how realistic/common your example of switching parents for=20
clk3 is. May be it is -- I would interested in what people have to say.

So, between clk_set_divider(), clk_set_parent() and clk_set_rate(), I=20
think we should be able to cover most clock trees as long as we don't=20
propagate clk_set_rate() to parents with more than one children. In=20
those case, the children should just implement clk_set_divider() (or not=20
even that if there is no divider) and not allow clk_set_rate().

I think you haven't seen all the repetition of refcounting and each=20
mach's implementation of some variant of clock ops. The current patch=20
set from Jeremy will certainly help cut down some of that. If we get the=20
"enable parent before you enable child, etc" in now, I don't think there=20
will be much churn when we try to add code to enforce the tree=20
restrictions you mention above.

While a lot of your points are correct, I don't think the current=20
patches from Jeremy are useless. May be I'm completely mistaken in=20
assuming that you are referring to Jeremy's patches?

Btw, on a slight tangent, there is also the problem of clk_round_rate()=20
not being sufficient when a driver is trying to work across different=20
mach's. I think we need a clk_set_rate_range(min, ideal, max) but I can=20
start a separate thread on that if you want. I talked about it a bit in=20
another thread.

Thanks,
Saravana
