Subject: [PATCH RFC v2 00/17] ARM: shmobile: r8a7779, marzen: multiplatform

The aim of this series is to adding common clock framework and in turn
multiplatform support to the r8a7779 SoC and marzen-reference.  It
subsequently removes non-multiplatform support from marzen-reference.
This last step is provided to illustrate that it can be done, it may not be
desirable to do so for some time.

This is based on work for R-Car Gen2 by Laurent Pinchart and Magnus Damm.

I expect the R-Car Gen2 work in this area to change and
I intend to update this series as necessary.


This series is based on the clocks/ccf/rcar-gen2 branch
of Laurent's fbdev tree. I expect that branch to be rebased/changed,
but it seems to be an adequate base for an RFC.

I have made this series, including its base, available
in the topic/clocks/ccf/r8a7779-marzen branch of my renesas tree.
That branch is likely to be rebased/changed in the future.
