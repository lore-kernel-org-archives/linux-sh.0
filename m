Hi Olof

Thank you for checking patch

Yes.
if (0 = bit[6]) clock is 1/2
if (1 = bit[6]) clock is 1/1

clcok A ---+  bit[7]                 bit[6]
           |- select -> usb24s -+--> divide (1/1 or 1/2) -> usb24

Ahh.. 50% yes.

_If_ this usb24/usb24s explanation on datasheet is same as other clocks,
it is easy to understand and can use clk_set_rate().

But this setting style of these 2 clock is very special case on our datasheet.
Maybe first case.
So, I added sample setting code here,
since it is difficult to understand how to set the clock from
datasheet/clock tree and clock-r8a7740.c
