Hi Olof, Hi Kevin, Hi Arnd,

Please consider these Renesas ARM based SoC CPG/MSTP clock driver updates
for v4.3.

As requested by Olof, this is a repost of patches broken out of a now
defunct pull-request, "Renesas ARM Based SoC CPG MSTP Clock Domain Updates
for v4.3".  The motivation being to have driver changes in a separate
branch to DT changes.

* These patches were Acked by Stephen Boyd in a reply to:
  [PATCH v2 00/14] ARM: shmobile: Add CPG Clock Domains
  https://lkml.org/lkml/2015/6/8/622
* The patch subjects were subsequently updated with other changes in:
  [PATCH v3 00/16] ARM: shmobile: Add CPG/MSTP Clock Domain
  https://lkml.org/lkml/2015/7/1/408
* And further updates were made in the patchset I queued up:
  [PATCH v4 00/16] ARM: shmobile: Add CPG/MSTP Clock Domain
  https://lkml.org/lkml/2015/8/4/389


The following changes since commit d770e558e21961ad6cfdf0ff7df0eb5d7d4f0754:

  Linux 4.2-rc1 (2015-07-05 11:01:52 -0700)
