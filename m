Hi Arnd,

Thanks for your email.

Indeed, there is still a lot to be done!

Good to hear that most ARM platforms will be converted by v3.10. This
is definitely something that I want to make happen for mach-shmobile
as well.

Our biggest challenge now is the move to common clocks. I suspect that
moving all our boards and SoCs to common clocks will take much longer
than v3.11 I'm afraid.

Starting with something smaller like EMEV2 may be a good first step.
So somehow I'd like to start converting them one by one, perhaps also
moving over the converted SoCs/boards to CONFIG_ARCH_MULTIPLATFORM in
an incremental fashion. Do you happen to have any example subarch that
has been migrated in an increment fashion already?

Regarding ARM_PATCH_PHYS_VIRT and AUTO_ZRELADDR, I believe those
should be enabled for the mach-shmobile bits that are used with
CONFIG_ARCH_MULTIPLATFORM. Best way forward there is TBD, any
recommendations would be very welcome!

Thanks,
