Hi everybody,

First of all, sorry for the patch bomb. I usually try to send smaller patch
sets by splitting them into coherent subsets, but getting the code in a proper
shape took time and required several iterations of the whole set.

These patches can be divided in 4 groups.

- Patches 01 to 29 rework the interface between the LCDC and MIPI/DSI and HDMI
  drivers. The MIPI/DSI and HDMI drivers are now FB-agnostic, except for the
  usage of the fb_videomode structure used to pass video mode information to
  the LCDC driver.

- Patches 30 to 38 perform additional cleanup to the LCDC driver made possible
  by the previous patches.

- Patches 39 to 54 rework the MERAM driver to allocate ICBs and MERAM regions
  automatically instead of relying on manually allocated regions specified in
  platform data. They're a first step in the longer term goal of making MERAM
  usable for other purpose than LCDC cache.

- Patches 55 to 57 add overlays support to the LCDC driver. They should be
  considered as a prototype implementation for now. I plan to rework them, but
  early feedback is always appreciated.

I would like to push patches 01 to 54 (after review of course) to v3.4 (or
v3.3 if time and review permits).
