Yes, exactly! Please note that the current drivers are written to be
DT aware and the IRQ code makes use of IRQ domains, so like you say
the DT -reference board code does not need to make use of these kind
of macros.

However, we are still not able to swith to DT fully due to lack of DT
support for PINMUX/GPIO. One even larger road block is the common
clock framework. And then we have the I/O power domains used with
Runtime PM on sh7372.

Thanks for your help,
