OK. So please change MSIOF to QSPI in the description.

According to the Spansion S25FL512S datasheet both mode 0 and mode 3
are supported:

"The difference between the two modes is the clock polarity when the bus
 master is in standby mode and not transferring any data.
   - SCK will stay at logic low state with CPOL = 0, CPHA = 0
   - SCK will stay at logic high state with CPOL = 1, CPHA = 1"

So this looks OK to me.

I gave it a try with a similar change to Koelsch, and it seems to work fine.

Please keep the spi-* properties together, and alphabetically sorted,
i.e. insert
the new ones before spi-max-frequency.

Thanks!
