Hi Kevin, Hi Olof, Hi Arnd,

please consider this third round of Renesas ARM based SoC DT updates for v3.14.

This is based on a merge of:

* The second round of Renesas ARM based SoC DT updates for v3.14,
  tagged as renesas-dt2-for-v3.14, which I have previously sent a
  pull-request for.

* The second round of Renesas ARM based SoC updates for v3.14,
  tagged as renesas-soc2-for-v3.14, which I have previously sent a
  pull-request for.

* The clk-next-shmobile branch of Mike Turquette's tree

* The clockevents/for-Simon-3.13-rc2 branch of Daniel Lezcano's tree

* The pinctl/for-next branch of Linus Walleij's tree

* v3.13-rc3


The reason for these merges is to provide dependencies for
the clock updates for the r8a7791 (R-Car M2) based Koelsch and r8a7790
(R-Car H2) based Lager boards.


The following changes since commit b652896b02df3dfde3a68957cce01f2aa4585842:
