What does the data sheet say?

The SDHI hardware block is included in the SoC. It may however need
some board specific configuration. I believe the correct way is to
define the common parts in the SoC-specific dtsi file and add
board-specific configuration in the board-specific dts file. Perhaps
you can consult Guennadi about this, he has been tasked with SDHI and
MMCIF.

In the SoC. As a general rule, if there is a platform device in
setup-nnnn.c then the device does not need any board specific
configuration. Such devices should be put in the SoC-specific dtsi
file.
