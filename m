This is exactly what I suggested in my last post, except the console example.
Only to be a part of common clock api because it's not very safe to assume
future SoCs will have the same simple clock topologies that they have today.

Not to mean to teach, but I hope you realize with more and more
device controller being crammed into ever shrinking SoCs,
clock would eventually have to be flexible in functionality
and complicated in hierarchy. Ben already gave examples
of Audio, MFC and Video controllers of latest Samsung SoCs.
