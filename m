If I'd track down all things I'm unsure about, we'll meet in heaven
again next time...
In this case the final reenabling of the IRQ is done in
intc_suspend(), which sounds totally fine.

Yes this is a shallow WFI sleep without power shutdowns.

Yes that's it. At least kind of inverted it's it. The INTCA is set to
edge trigger mode.

So what happens is this: The I2C bus shuts down and we still accept
st1232 IRQs. The st1232 registers its handler with the flag
IRQF_ONESHOT as the handler is threaded. This means the line gets
masked out until the handler finished. Now an IRQ arrives, the ack
fails because I2C is down and this makes the IRQ line stay asserted.
The IRQ handler thread gets frozen by suspend (this is my assumption)
but the INTC suspend code reactivates the IRQ line as a wakeup source
(verified). The INTC code triggers no IRQ now as we are in edge
detection mode. When I switch to low level detection the SoC wakes and
we don't get stuck.

Side note: The ICR2 register looks strange, it's: 0x4444. This sets
IRQ15 to IRQ12 to edge detection on both sides and IRQ11 to IRQ8 to
falling edge detection. To me this looks a bit arbitrary.

Thanks for sharing these ideas.

Yes sure, I will include more next time!

For both test cases I used Linux 3.8-rc7 and coded directly on top of
it. Unfortunately I don't remember the oldest tag I've seen this bug
on.

Yep I'm close to understand the INTCA.

So maybe code is missing that unmasks wakeup sources as it is done in INTCA.

I'll take a look at the sh73a0 case later.
