It's quite obvious from the thread that the on-demand device probing is
*not* going to be merged for 4.4, and so it should not be in linux-next
at all.  Having it in linux-next, it's disrupting people's testing of
the 4.4 merge window material.

Tomeu, please remove it so people can continue to test material
sheduled for the 4.4 merge window.  Thanks.
