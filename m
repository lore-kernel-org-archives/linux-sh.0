I think you advised once to cc cpufreq related mails to linux-pm too at 
least. I haven't found this patch in my pm archive, have I missed it 
there?

No, I don't. I only know that in __cpufreq_driver_target() the check for

	if (policy->transition_ongoing) {
		write_unlock_irqrestore(&cpufreq_driver_lock, flags);
		return -EBUSY;
	}

is failing with this patch and cpufreq-cpu0.

If I understood correctly, this patch fixed some warnings, that, however, 
didn't disrupt functionality, is this right? Whereas the patch really 
seems to break working set ups.

Anyway, we know about the problem now and I believe it'll get fixed one 
way or another.

Thanks
