Is there any harm in making the default be mark all cores present then 
let the platform code clear the present state if so desired? This was my 
intention.

Thanks for the explanation. I now see that for my case I won't need the 
pen code at all.

What about the scu_init_cpus patch? You posted something similar as 
Stephen pointed out that I had missed. Do you plan to merge that?
