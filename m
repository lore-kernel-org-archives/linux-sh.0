Yes, I know that the update is very small.
But "renesas,r8a7793-cpg-clocks" which will be added to the documentation
was not found anywhere in the source tree. For example,
"renesas,r8a7794-cpg-clocks"
is found in arch/arm/boot/dts/r8a7794.dtsi.
Is r8a7793.dtsi not necessary to update the document?
