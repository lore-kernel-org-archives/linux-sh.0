There seem to be two ways to specify the maximum LCDC resolution today:

1) The highest resolution specified by the lcd_cfg array.
2) The default MAX_XRES / MAX_YRES.

Your patch is good in the sense that it starts using the limits from
above in check_var(), but only for case 2). Perhaps it would be good
to walk the lcd_cfg arrray to handle case 1) too?

Also, about case 2), I don't really see why we need it. I would much
prefer to treat missing platform data information as an error case.

With the current hard coded MAX_XRES / MAX_YRES the driver needs to be
updated now and then. I'm sure there are many good reasons to update
the driver, but having to do so just to increase the max resolution
seems a bit silly to me. Also, with the MAX_XRES / MAX_YRES there is a
silent assumption about the maximum resolution that has nothing to do
with the LCDC hardware capabilities at all.

I understand you may need to allocate memory early for the hotplug
HDMI case, but it must be possible to specify the maximum resolution
with platform data in that case too, no?

As for breaking other platforms, if there are any users of the LCDC
driver in mode 2) above that assume that MAX_XRES / MAX_YRES allocate
720p memory then they may break with this patch. The pain may be
limited to allocating more memory than actually needed though, but
that may cause a run-time error anyway depending on the MAX_ZONEORDER
kernel configuration.

So if possible I'd like to get rid of 2) above. And use the lcd_cfg
array in check_var(). Does it make sense?

Thanks,
