I have no experience with DMA on SH, only with DMA on (DT-based) Renesas
ARM SoCs. But I believe the DMA engines are somewhat similar.

I don't know if all pieces to support DMA were ever upstreamed.
See e.g. commit 219fb0c1436e4893 ("serial: sh-sci: Remove the platform data
dma slave rx/tx channel IDs").

Perhaps Guennadi knows/remembers?
