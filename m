I presume you're talking about an external tmio MFD chip connected to a   
PXA SoC. Concerning adding DMA to this configuration, just like Magnus, I 
am not aware of any dmaengine implementations for PXA. I know, there is a 
private PXA DMA API, used, e.g., in pxa_camera.c and defined in 
arch/arm/plat-pxa/dma.c. I think, that's also what you would use for 
external DMA.

There has been a discussion whether the dmaengine API should be used 
universally, and the conclusion more or less was:

1. if your DMA engine can do standard operations like memcpy, xor, then 
yes
2. if you use drivers for external hardware or built-in IP blocks, that 
use the dmaengine API, then yes
3. otherwise it's not compulsory

So, until now PXA didn't have any of the (1) or (2) cases. Now, if you 
want to use tmio on PXA you have a choice: either (1) to add a new DMA 
glue to tmio for PXA, or (2) to add a dmaengine API to PXA DMA. The latter 
seems to be preferred. But even if you decide to go the first route, this 
driver split shall make your work easier.
