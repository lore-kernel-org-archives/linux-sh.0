If the OF PCI range code allowed the PCIe host driver to determine if it's 
a 32-bit mapping, we could use that and get a small performance 
improvement with PCIe throughput.

With this controller, you can only specify maps whose size are a power of 
two, and the size must be less than or equal to the cpu address alignment. 
Further, when the size is 4GiB, you have to use a 64-bit mapping. Thinking 
about it, the 4GiB case is not relevant to our discussion about 32-bit vs 
64-bit mappings.

Still, my comment about the OF PCI range code treating both 32 and 64-bit 
types the same way means that PCIe host driver has to assume it's a 64-bit 
mapping.

Thanks
