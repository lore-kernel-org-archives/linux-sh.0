Looks like this is the best acknowledgment/response I can expect to get 
from Russell on this point that I raised.

Jeremy,

When you update the comments/doc to indicate clk_prepare/unprepare is 
not atomic, can you also update the comment for set_rate() and mark it 
as non-atomic?

Thanks for starting this thread. My efforts to reignite the other thread 
didn't go anywhere. Glad to see it's moving forward.

Unrelated to this thread, but I Ack this request too.
