Ugh. So, the irq branch depends on the old soc branch, and now this depends on
the irq branch (and it is soc code). That's a circular dependency.

I'll add this as a next/soc2 branch in arm-soc, but please think about these
kind of circular dependencies in the future, and try to avoid them if you can
by splitting the branch contents in separate topics if possible.

Likewise, there's a bunch of patches in this branch such as the fixed divisor
clock patches that could be considered cleanup. Not a big deal to group them
with the soc code, but if you're already doing cleanup branches it'd be just as
well to put them in those.
