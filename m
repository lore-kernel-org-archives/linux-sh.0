Hi Olof, Hi Kevin, Hi Arnd,

Please consider these second round of Renesas ARM based SoC DT updates for
v3.19.

This pull request is based on the previous round of
such requests, tagged as renesas-dt-for-v3.19,
which I have already sent a pull-request for.

As requested by Arnd v2 of this pull request does not include some
Audio DMAC patches that were included in v1.

The following changes since commit 25af9c83151822eb6d413b4d15d5f89804606ac7:

  ARM: shmobile: r8a7779 dtsi: Add SoC-specific SATA compatible property (2014-10-30 10:01:37 +0900)
