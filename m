Hi,

this pathcset adds basic support for the Renesas R-Car H3 (R8A7795) SoC
and its Saovator-X board.

This series has undergone a number of rounds of development and review
on the linux-sh mailing list. This is the first posting to a wider audience
from which we are now seeking review.

It is anticpated that the CPG bindings used this patchset will be
changed before they hit mainline and thus this patchset will need
to be updated accordinly. Reviwers are advised to skip over that portion
of this patchset unless they have a particlar interest in that discussion.


Based on v4.3-rc1.

Further run-time dependencies are included in the
topic/gen3-latest branch of Geert Uytterhoeven's renesas-drivers tree.
which currently includes these patches less the MAINTAINERS update.

To aid review (and Geert's branch preparation) this series is available in
the topic/arm64-rcar-gen3-v11 branch of the my renesas tree.
