ARM: shmobile: r8a73a4 SoC support V3
[PATCH 01/04] ARM: shmobile: Initial r8a73a4 SoC support V3
[PATCH 02/04] ARM: shmobile: r8a73a4 SCIF support V3
[PATCH 03/04] ARM: shmobile: r8a73a4 IRQC support V2
[PATCH 04/04] ARM: shmobile: r8a73a4 PFC support

This series is V3 of initial support for the r8a73a4 SoC. The SoC
is known as r8a73a4 which is built around Cortex-A15 and makes use
of SCIF for serial, IRQC interrupt controller for external IRQs and
PFC for combined support for pinmux and GPIO.

Changes in V3:
- Added clock mapping for all supported root clocks
- Fixed a bug in the SCIF patch where PORT_SCIFA was always being selected

Updated PFC and APE6EVM series will be on top of this one.
