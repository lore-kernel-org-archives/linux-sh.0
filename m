I've got 2 different patterns happening on the KZM9G and the Armadillo800EVA.

Armadillo:
I provoke a fail by using the touchscreen while suspending that
triggers the first "intc disable 10 10" (see below). The suspend code
disables all(?) IRQ lines and after
"PM: noirq suspend of devices complete after 4901.016 msecs"
the wakeup sources get reenabled. In fact I'm unsure if the IRQ line
10 gets reenabled by the generic IRQ handling code when reenabling the
line after handling it or if it is done by code that sets up the
wakeup sources. IRQ 14 is a GPIO button that is marked as a wakeup
source in the board code:
GPIO_KEY(KEY_POWER,     GPIO_PORT99,    "SW3", .wakeup = 1),

Now the strange thing here is that even after enabling IRQ line 10
("intc write8: addr e0804064, h 2034a25, data 20" is the correct write
to unmask it) the touchscreen stays dead and I can't wake using it.
Even if I wake it using the GPIO key the st1232 stays dead and I don't
get any more interrupts from it.

When I suspend while not using the touchscreen I get the same sequence
without the inital "intc disable 10 10" and no i2c timeout happens and
I am able to wake from the st1232.

Here my log:

KZM9G:

Here even if I don't produce IRQs from the st1232 I can't wake without
the patch. The IRQ gets disabled as in the log above but there is no
reenabling at all. So my patch stops disabling the IRQ line in the
first place and we are able to use it as a wakeup source.

PM: noirq suspend of devices complete after 25.146 msecs
Disabling non-boot CPUs ...

No wakeup possible here. Btw there is 1 more thing that confuses me:
The touchscreen IRQ line is 424 in /proc/interrupts: 424:         34
       0  INTCA-GIC-level     st1232-ts
but when using it I get
intc disable 568 568
intc write8: addr df00a044, h 2034a27, data 80
intc enable 568 568
intc write8: addr df00a064, h 2034a27, data 80

But IRQ line 568 doesn't exist at all in /proc/interrupts. Can you explain that?


So you are probably right, there is something phony in the interrupt
controller code. And probably in 2 different spots.

 Bastian
