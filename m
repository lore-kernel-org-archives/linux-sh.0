Ok, I tried applying this against all of the fbdev topic branches in the
sh tree, the fbdev tree, and Linus's tree (where the fbdev tree was just
merged), and it doesn't apply to any of them, so I have no idea what tree
you are working with, or if there are some dependencies or something that
you haven't specified.
