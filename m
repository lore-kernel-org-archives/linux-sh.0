Definitely not.  That's only 8 different possibilities per canary, and
the weakest one will affect exploitability in each scenario.  So that
would be a fairly clear change to the worse.

I suggest that we make no further changes at this time, unless someone
comes up with an idea that would clearly hurt exploitation more than it
helps exploitation, overall across different scenarios.
