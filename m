Hmm, this is more about a driver being removed rather than the device.
Then perhaps we could make it __clk_nodrv_* or clk_nodrv_* ?

But the clock is being dropped from the clock tree immediately in this
function. After the hlist_del_init() call below the clock is not present
on any clocks list. Upon clock release only the memory allocated for
the clock is freed.

This shouldn't be necessary, for the reason described above. I've tested
multiple registrations when a clock was being referenced by a consumer
driver and it worked well.

I'm still a bit unsure about the kref reference counting, but I'd would
assume it is good to have. It prevents the kernel to crash in some
situations. Many other subsystems/drivers crash miserably when a driver
gets unbound using the sysfs "unbind" attribute. However, if it is assumed
that user space needs to keep track of respective resource references
and should know what it does when unbinding drivers, then we could probably
do without the kref. I'm seriously sceptical though about letting user
space to crash the kernel in fairly simple steps, it just doesn't sound
right.
