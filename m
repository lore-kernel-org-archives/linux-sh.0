Ok, thanks, I'll have a look to it.

Just for my understanding: Yes, if other properties from ePAPR like 
geometry of the cache are added to the device tree l2 cache entries 
then it makes sense to have them.

But an "empty" entry like the one given in the example above doesn't 
make much sense and could be removed without loosing any functionality?

It looks to me that most of the L2 entries we have in 
arch/arm64/boot/dts are such "empty" entries.

Is this understanding correct?

Best regards

Dirk
