No disagreement on that. However, as Geert pointed out, my question was 
related to the split between dmaengine_submit() and dma_async_issue_pending(), 
not between the prep_* functions and dmaengine_submit().

That really triggers a red alarm in the part of my brain that deals with API 
design, but I suppose it would be too difficult to change that.

Not on callbacks, but on how pending descriptors are pushed to the hardware. 
The flag is explicitly checked in dma_issue_pending_all().

DMA_PRIVATE is a dma_device flag, not a dma_chan flag. As soon as one channel 
is allocated by __dma_request_channel() the whole device is marked with 
DMA_PRIVATE, making all channels private. What am I missing ?

Thank you for the confirmation. I'll see if I can cook up a patch. It will 
likely be pretty large and broad though, but I guess there's no way around it.

Thank you for the information. How about the dma_async_* functions, should 
they be renamed to dmaengine_* as well ? Or are some of them part of the 
async_tx_* API ?
