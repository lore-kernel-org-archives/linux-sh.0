If it's just meant to serve as an example...

There is already an example in e.g. r8a7791-koelsch.dts, for MSIOF0.
Given the implementer may have to change the "C" set of pins to the set of
pins he wants to use, I think it's a minor hassle to also have to change the
MSIOF instance number. And he may want to use MSIOF2 or 3, too.
