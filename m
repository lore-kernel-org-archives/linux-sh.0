Yeah, I had similar thoughts when I added the new test.

include/linux/cpumask.h:
 *     cpu_possible_mask- has bit 'cpu' set iff cpu is populatable
 *     cpu_present_mask - has bit 'cpu' set iff cpu is populated
 *     cpu_online_mask  - has bit 'cpu' set iff cpu available to scheduler
 *     cpu_active_mask  - has bit 'cpu' set iff cpu available to migration
