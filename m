No, they're not. The channels can be implemented with different counter 
widths, different available prescalers and source clocks and different power 
management features (not all of them are capable to run in all sleep states).

Probably not. I suppose the rating should be computed by the driver based on 
the source clock frequency, prescaler and counter width. Any help there would 
be very appreciated, I'm pretty new to clock source and clock event devices.
