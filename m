Mine to, but there's not a lot which can be done about it without
changing a lot of users.

Right.  So, let me put a question to you - what do you think is the
effect of the check in dma_issue_pending_all()?

I'll give you a hint - disregard the comment at the top of the function,
because that's out of date.

I can't answer that - I don't know why the previous authors decided to
make it a DMA-device wide property - presumably there are DMA controllers
where this matters.

However, one thing to realise is that a dma_device is a virtual concept -
it is a set of channels which share a common set of properties.  It is not
a physical device.  It is entirely reasonable for a set of channels on a
physical device to be shared between two different dma_device instances
and handed out by the driver code as needed.

Well, these:

dma_async_device_register
dma_async_device_unregister
dma_async_tx_descriptor_init

are more DMA engine core <-> DMA engine driver interface functions than
user functions.  The remainder of the dma_async_* functions are internal
to the async_tx API.
