Ah, I didn't know that was a goal.  I totally agree there.

Sounds good to me.

I'll have a look again after you post your series, but I'm pretty sure
any runtime PM implementation based on basic clock gating could be
shared.  Basically, the idea is in the absence of real power domains, to
create a default "virtual" powerdomain that contains every device with a
clock.  This would capture all on-chip devices into a single power domain.
The device powerdomain callbacks for these would do the basic clock
gating (as is done in mach-shmobile/pm_runtime.c).
