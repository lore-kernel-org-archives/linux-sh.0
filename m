That was my first idea when I looked at patch 3, but then I had the other

We must not introduce the user interface in one kernel and then change
it in the next one, so I'm cautious about taking the pull request in
the current form. Once we have agreed on what the contents of the sysfs
files should be, I can take the patches, and then we are free to move
the implementation later.
