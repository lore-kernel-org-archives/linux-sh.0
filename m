I assumed that would be trivial to change, by calling rcar_pcie_hw_init
at the end of rcar_pcie_phy_init_rcar_h1 rather than the other way round.

If you need to support the case without a boot loader, that would be
a good reason to leave the code in.

Otherwise, I think it's better to mandate early that the boot loader
sets up a lot of the basic stuff. As long as nobody has a kernel that
does the same setup, you also won't see any boot loaders that get it
wrong, because they never work. It's also easy enough to add back
if you later have to support a broken boot loader.

Ok. There is actually work on the way to simplify this a lot
so you don't have to do it in the driver, but it will probably
take a little more time, especially since Will Deacon is on an
extended vacation at the moment and he was driving things.

The seems less obvious to rely on though, it's quite common
for newer hardware to have multiple blocks of whatever the first
generation has only one of ;-)

Ok.

Ok, in this case it sounds like you should definitely use the dma-ranges
property, since it's possibly that board designers put their ram in funny
places. You probably want to have a dma-ranges property with three 4GB
entries then and document the size limitation in the pci host binding,
rather than a single entry spanning all of RAM.
