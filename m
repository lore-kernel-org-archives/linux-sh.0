Hi all,

These patches are an attempt to allow platforms to share clock code. At
present, the definitions of 'struct clk' are local to platform code,
which makes allocating and initialising cross-platform clock sources
difficult, and makes it impossible to compile a single image containing
support for two ARM platforms with different struct clks.

The three patches are for the architecture-independent kernel code,
introducing the common clk infrastructure. The changelog for the first
patch includes details about the new clock definitions.

Ben Herrenschmidt is looking at using common struct clk code for powerpc
too, hence the kernel-wide approach.

Many thanks to the following for their input:
 * Ben Dooks <ben-linux@fluff.org>
 * Baruch Siach <baruch@tkos.co.il>
 * Russell King <linux@arm.linux.org.uk>
 * Uwe Kleine-K=C3=B6nig <u.kleine-koenig@pengutronix.de>
 * Lorenzo Pieralisi <Lorenzo.Pieralisi@arm.com>
 * Vincent Guittot <vincent.guittot@linaro.org>
 * Sascha Hauer <s.hauer@pengutronix.de>

Cheers,


Jeremy
