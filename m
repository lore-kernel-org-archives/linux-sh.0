All the Samsung SoCs have multiple PLLs as the root of their clock
trees, with some muxing options to feed in oscillator inputs. Many
of the systems I've seen have a 48MHz source for the USB, 12MHz
as a PLL source and then generate a pile of different frequencies for
various peripherals via the PLLs...

this is especially important for the cases where you need very specific
frequencies such as audio playback of tv encoding.
