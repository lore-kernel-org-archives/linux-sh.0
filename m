It's mostly an issue for PMICs (and possibly some other similar things)
so that the regulators are present before their consumers try to start.
I'm not aware of any issues with I2C itself.

In general embedded platforms register I2C early as things like PMICs
typically hang off them.  Grant was trying to push people to use
deferred registration for this stuff but it didn't happen yet and I'd
personally be more comfortable with more infastructure supporting that.
