This series lacks a description of why this is desired.

My strong opinion is that it's not desired at all: /dev/mem never 
worked beyond 4G addresses so by today it has become largely obsolete 
and is on the way out really.

I'm aware of these current /dev/mem uses:

 - Xorg maps below 4G non-RAM addresses and the video BIOS

 - It used to have some debugging role but these days kexec and kgdb 
   has largely taken over that role - partly due to the 4G limit.

 - there's some really horrible out-of-tree drivers that do mmap()s
   via /dev/mem, those should be fixed if they want to move beyond 
   4G: their char device should be mmap()able.

 - all distro kernel's i'm aware of use CONFIG_STRICT_DEVMEM=y, which
   restricts /dev/mem to non-RAM pages of physical memory.
   [ With the sad inclusion of the first 1MB, which Xorg needs. ]

Are you aware of any legitimate usecases?

Frankly, i dont think we ever *want* to 'fix' /dev/mem to support 
addresses beyond 4G and grow messy userspace (and kernelspace) that 
somehow relies on that. Thank goodness that we never supported it ...

Thanks,

	Ingo
