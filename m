Hi Simon

These are r8a7795/salvator-x sound support for latest branch.
(These are posted few month ago and were queued on Simon's branch)

I could have sound by this order

	> git checkout renesas-devel-20151123-v4.4-rc2
	> git merge  geert/topic/cpg-mssr-v6
	> git am -3 ${THESE-PATCH-SET}

These supports 44.1kHz sound only. 48kHz sound needs cs2000 driver
which is posted to ML (clk maintainer accepted ?)
I can send cs2000 support if it was accepted.
