Yes, that's because the per-user struct clk messed quite a lot of things
up - the patches were /not/ well tested before they went in.

That's no excuse to work around the breakage they caused though.

That said, I never did post the work I did earlier this month to fix the
problems in clkdev which those patches caused... so, I guess it's time
to post them and rush them in for the 4.1 merge window...  (frankly, the
per-user struct clk patches should've been reverted.)
