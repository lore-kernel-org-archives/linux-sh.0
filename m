I think so too.

I understand that you feel that static mapping in the case of SMP is acceptable.

Good to hear that that this may be a move in the right direction!

I am not sure how this is related to device drivers actually. The
example I was thinking about was snapshot-style development on some
ancient kernel version. In that case the developers simply seemed to
follow the at-that-point common coding style in the ARM architecture.
I am happy to see that the ARM architecture code is getting cleaner
bit by bit.

Uhm, I am not sure where you got that idea about the INTC driver.
Allow me to clarify.

Regarding the shared INTC code base I recall implementing ioremap()
support there 2010, feel free to search the archives for "[PATCH] sh:
INTC ioremap support V2".

As for actual SoC support, this varies with interrupt controller and
SoC. It is basically a matter of if I/O memory windows are passed to
the INTC driver or not.

A typical example would be sh7372 that has two interrupt controllers:
INTCA and INTCS. In intc-sh7372.c you have the following:

INTCA (no resources - using the 0xe6xxxxxx 1:1 mapping):

static DECLARE_INTC_DESC(intca_desc, "sh7372-intca",
			 intca_vectors, intca_groups,
			 intca_mask_registers, intca_prio_registers,
			 NULL);

INTCS (resources - relies on ioremap()):

static struct resource intcs_resources[] __initdata = {
	[0] = {
		.start	= 0xffd20000,
		.end	= 0xffd201ff,
		.flags	= IORESOURCE_MEM,
	},
	[1] = {
		.start	= 0xffd50000,
		.end	= 0xffd501ff,
		.flags	= IORESOURCE_MEM,
	}
};

static struct intc_desc intcs_desc __initdata = {
	.name = "sh7372-intcs",
	.force_enable = ENABLED_INTCS,
	.skip_syscore_suspend = true,
	.resource = intcs_resources,
	.num_resources = ARRAY_SIZE(intcs_resources),
	.hw = INTC_HW_DESC(intcs_vectors, intcs_groups, intcs_mask_registers,
			   intcs_prio_registers, NULL, NULL),
};

Adding I/O memory resources to the already existing INTC controllers
is not a particularly difficult task. Would you like us to perform
such a change?

If you look at all our regular device drivers we use a base register +
offset. In such cases that kind of design makes a lot of sense.

In the case of INTC and PFC we do not follow this style. This since
each version of the hardware block varies quite a bit and there often
are a couple of I/O memory windows associated with each hardware block
instance. So the design has been to use the same physical addresses as
are described in the data sheet, and for bit fields and register width
follow the same type of representation as the data sheet to allow easy
development and validation.

Keep in mind that in arch/sh and arch/arm we have over 30 different
variants of INTC hardware blocks.

So to summarize, INTC, PFC and CPG (clocks) have ioremap support
included in the actual driver code. If the SoC makes use of it or not
is a different question. =)

So how would you like to proceed with this matter?
