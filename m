That would mandate that all the architecture-specific pt_regs structures 
would have to use a top-level named field for each named register.  That 
seems to me like an unnecessary restriction when the point of 
regs_offset_table is to provide the offset of the register inside an 
arbitarily complex pt_regs struct.  The often redundant definition of 
these two macros doesn't seem to me that high a price for that.
