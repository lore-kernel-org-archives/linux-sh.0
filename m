The reason for an off slab configuration is denser object packing.

Hmmm.. Yes seems to be an option.

Maybe we simply revert commit 8fc9cf420b36 instead? That does not seem to
make too much sense to me and the goal of the commit cannot be
accomplished on ARM. Your patch essentially reverts the effect anyways.

Smaller slabs really do not need off slab management anyways since they
will only loose a few objects per slab page.
