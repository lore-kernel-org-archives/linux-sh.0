Yes, you are correct.
Many devices are existing in Renesas chip, not only EHCI/OHCI.

But in r8a7778 case, these ehci/ohci doesn't work if usb-phy wasn't enabled,
and without PFC settings from platform.

I'm sorry.
This mention (= phy and ohci/ehci registration in one function) was my fault.
Your style is correct I think.
