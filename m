It's worth mentioning that Geert's patch stops both the rcar-pcie driver and the
rcar-pci-gen2 driver from being built on arm64 due to build failures for both of
them. The rcar-pci-gen2 driver is not for R-Car Gen3 devices, and so should not
be built for arm64. The rcar-pcie driver will be used on R-Car Gen3 devices.

So if we don't use Geert's patch, I need to fix the rcar-pcie driver so it doesn't
use pci_ioremap_io(), _and_ fix Kconfig so that the rcar-pci-gen2 driver doesn't
get built on arm64. 
Let's just use Geert's patch for now.

Btw, I saw no build breakages on next as SHMOBILE is currently not included in
arm64.

Thanks
Phil
