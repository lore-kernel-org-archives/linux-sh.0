Indeed, the real difference are the barriers in repeated IO operations.

Errors, that I've been observing were happening with no DMA, in pure PIO 
mode.

Unfortunately, I don't have a good explanation, why the barriers _have_ to 
be there, where I put them. At some point during my testing, I had 
printk()s in the code and SDIO worked. Then the classical - remove 
printk()s - stops working. Delays didn't halp, but barriers did. The 
motivation to put a write barrier before a (repeated) read was to wait for 
completion of any write operations before starting a read. And indeed, 
normal write operations, like writew() / iowrite16() have a write barrier 
_before_ the write. So, isn't it possible, that the last write hasn't 
completed yet, while we begin with reading? But reads / writes should, 
probably, anyway be serialised on the bus...

It's also possible, that these errors are related to runtime 
power-management, which would involve IO to other SoC peripherals. But 
they all should also contain barriers, so, this doesn't explain it 
immediately either.
