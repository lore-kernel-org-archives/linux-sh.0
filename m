ARM: shmobile: sh73a0, r8a7779 and emev2 SMP SCU rework

[PATCH 01/07] ARM: shmobile: Introduce shared SCU SMP boot code
[PATCH 02/07] ARM: shmobile: Use shared SCU SMP boot code on sh73a0
[PATCH 03/07] ARM: shmobile: Use shared SCU SMP boot code on r8a7779
[PATCH 04/07] ARM: shmobile: Use shared SCU SMP boot code on emev2
[PATCH 05/07] ARM: shmobile: Add shared SCU CPU Hotplug code
[PATCH 06/07] ARM: shmobile: Use shared SCU CPU Hotplug code on sh73a0
[PATCH 07/07] ARM: shmobile: Use shared SCU CPU Hotplug code on r8a7779

This series consolidates mach-shmobile SMP code into SCU specific code
for SMP boot and CPU Hotplug. The shared SCU code will in the future hook
into some low level assembly code that provides SMP boot and sleep
functionality, so this is is also preparations for future work.

 Requires "[PATCH] ARM: Fix memblock_reserve() to include stext" during
 run time to allow test of CPU Hotplug with v3.11-rc kernels.
