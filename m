It probably made more sense on real Open Firmware than it does on FDT, but
we're trying to follow the bindings anyway.

I believe the "device_type=pci" originally indicated a device that has
a readable config space (through the OF client interface), which is true
for both the host and the devices.

We have some common helpers for "ranges" parsing already, but we should
improve them so a driver has to do much less in the future.

For "dma-ranges", we still to write need most of the code. For platform
devices, we can now calculate the offset for the simple (no IOMMU) case,
but we still need to calculate the dma mask correctly (that part should
be simple, maybe you can help there as you have an immediate need),
and we need to handle the IOMMU and swiotlb cases better.

For PCI devices, we need to do all the same things we do for platform
devices, and we can probably share most of the code.
