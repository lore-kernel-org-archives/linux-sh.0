Oh, right, I guess it doesn't know the link address now when the C
bits are gone. Sorry about that, I totally forgot about the defconfig.

At this point I think we should fix up the defconfig to build for
kzm9d with single platform. So instead of enabling MULTI in the
kzmd_defconfig, how about this?

CONFIG_AUTO_ZRELADDR=y

Also, it seems that the "select USE_OF" went away with the board code
Kconfig bits. I will send a patch for that right away.

Cheers,
