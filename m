Hi Wolfram,

Thanks for your updated series. For this patch I only have a minor
comment. I believe we only want to enable the serial port that is used
on the board. At the same time we want to keep the same ordering as
the legacy code. I believe you keep the same order already and only
enable ttySC2, but I wonder if you really need all the aliases above?
Perhaps it is possible to keep just serial2?

Cheers,
