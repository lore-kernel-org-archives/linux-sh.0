Indeed it is needed for device-to-device DMA transfer,
but, it is using generic dmaengine style.
(see linux/sound/soc/sh/rcar/core.c, linux/drivers/dma/sh/rcar-audmapp.c)
If I exchange dmaengine binding style for device-to-device,
I need to change both dmaengine driver and sound driver.
But, I want to know why I should do it ?
Indeed it needs many DMA binding entries now, but, it is using normal dmaengine bindings.
