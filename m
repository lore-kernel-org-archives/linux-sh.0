Yes, that is the case. I have some patches (from Geert) queued up for v4.1.
I have confirmed that they do not conflict with the shmobile (last) patch
if this series.

<details>
The patches are in the sh-drivers-for-v4.1 branch of my renesas tree; I
rebased them yesterday; they should hit next today if there is a next
today; I plan to send a pull request to Linus in the not to distant future;
and I envisage they should end up in v4.1-rc2 or rc3.  </details>

Likewise.

Here is an ack for the shmobile (last) patch if you decide to take it
through your tree.
