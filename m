Can I get an 'ack' for this change? We merged a binding for "nor-jedec"
in 4.1-rc1, with review (but no explicit 'ack') from Mark, and a few
DTS's are starting to use it. But we're now seeing objections, with a
request to change this to "jedec,spi-nor". I don't care too much, but I
can understand Stephen's point.

Anyway, I don't want to go through too many more patch cycles without an
explicit ack here on the "jedec,spi-nor" binding (i.e.,
s/nor-jedec/jedec,spi-nor/g). With an ack, then I can make sure the
binding and current users get changed before 4.1 is minted, and prevent
other ARM subarchitectures from pulling in the "wrong" binding for 4.2.

Brian
