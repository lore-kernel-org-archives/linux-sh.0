Yes, you're right, I forgot about that discussion, sorry. But my 
motivation was the following: yes, I'm aware, that the DT should only 
describe real hardware _devices_ and hardware _properties_. But this patch 
- just like your original patch - don't add a pseudo _device_ or 
_property_, but a compatibility string. So, to me it was like "a class of 
all systems, where the CPU performance can be scaled using one power 
supply and one clock. Isn't this a hardware feature? We already have CPU 
nodes in DT, this would be just (an additional) compatibility string to 
them? I'll be happy to drop this patch and revive yours, if we manage to 
agree upon the scope.

Thanks
