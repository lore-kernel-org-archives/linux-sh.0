Thanks!

We could make use of the ->set_clk_div() callback and configure the
parent clock whenever that is possible.

Uhm, this is not entirely correct. The sh7372 used by Mackerel is in
this case similar to most older SH processors and shares a clock
between all SDHI hardware blocks. This clock is also shared with a
bunch of other peripherals, so we can't adjust it freely during
runtime.

The sh73a0 processor has per-SDHI block clock control.

It most likely would. Perhaps it's worth adjusting the shared clock a
bit to support 20MHz?

Thanks,
