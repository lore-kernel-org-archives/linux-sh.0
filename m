Ok, sounds good.

One general question about your plans (probably more for Magnus than for you):
What is your expected time line for moving shmobile under
CONFIG_ARCH_MULTIPLATFORM? It seems you are making great progress, but
there is also still a lot to be done.

I expect that in 3.10, we will have all ARMv6 and ARMv7 platforms converted,
with the exception of realview, mmp, s5p, msm, and shmobile. I'm sure we
can do realview and mmp for 3.11, possibly also s5p. For shmobile, I think
most of the work would be changing drivers/sh/clk to integrate into the common
clk framework, and you need to find a way to enable ARM_PATCH_PHYS_VIRT and
AUTO_ZRELADDR. Are those things you think can be done for 3.11?
