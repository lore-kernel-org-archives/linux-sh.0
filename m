	Hi Simon, Magnus, Arnd,

This patch series extends the PM domain platform driver for the R-Mobile
System Controller (SYSC) to register a restart handler, and removes the
restart handler hacks on DT-based R-Mobile A1 (r8a7740) and SH-Mobile AG5
(sh73a0) platforms.

Note that this supports DT-based platforms only. Legacy platforms keep
on using the restart callback in struct machine_desc.

This was tested on r8a7740/armadillo-multiplatform,
sh73a0/kzm9g-reference, and sh73a0/kzm9g-multiplatform.

Arnd: is this what you had in mind in your response to "[GIT PULL] Third
Round of Renesas ARM Based Soc Updates for v3.19"
(http://www.spinics.net/lists/arm-kernel/msg379348.html)?

Dependencies:
  - The first two patches depend on the series "[PATCH v6 0/7] ARM:
    shmobile: R-Mobile: DT PM domain support", as that series adds the
    SYSC PM domain platform driver for DT-based platforms and adds the
    SYSC device node to r8a7740.dtsi,
  - The last two patches also depend on the series "[PATCH RFC 0/7] ARM:
    shmobile: sh73a0: DT PM domain support", as that series adds the
    SYSC device node to sh73a0.dtsi.

Thanks!
