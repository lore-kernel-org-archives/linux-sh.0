Sorry, I misunderstood you at first. I thought you meant you only split
them up when you apply them yourself. It's no problem for me to split
up this patch as well and then apply it here.

I agree that it's not nice, but I couldn't come with a better approach,
and we are doing the same thing on other platforms as well.

The problems are:

* leaving the code as it is today prevents me from running all
  'make randconfig' kernels successfully. I use this as an important
  test case for verifying stuff we pull into the arm-soc tree.
  At the moment, I have a 160-patch series that I want to get merged
  upstream over time.

* Using 'select PHYLIB' from the platform is nasty because we want
  to be able to turn off whole subsystems (BLOCK, NET, I2C, ...)
  in Kconfig independent of the board selection. PHYLIB requires
  the network code.

* Using 'depends on' to disable the board option if PHYLIB is
  a module is counterintuitive.

* Makeing PHYLIB always built-in when NETDEVICE is would be a
  bit wasteful.

I don't have any other ideas for solving this.
