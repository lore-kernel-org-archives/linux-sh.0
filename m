Hi Simon,

Thanks for your work on this! It's nice to see that you can actually
load some data early on.

Regarding the destination address, look into using CONFIG_MEMORY_START
or perhaps something more advanced like the actual destination address
for the kernel - see arch/arm/boot/compressed/head.S and TEXT_OFFSET
or zreladdr.

As for the number of bytes to load, please have a look at the sh7724
implementation.

This seems like a board specific property to me. So please break it
out in to a per-board header or similar.

I guess next step is to extend the prototype code so it loads the
entire kernel from MMC and then jumps to it. =3D)
