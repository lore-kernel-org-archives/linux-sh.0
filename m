Armadillo uses hermit, not u-boot, and boots a zImage with appended DTB.
I tried disabling CONFIG_ARCH_QCOM, but it didn't make a difference.
It does boot the shmobile_defconfig kernel, which is only 3 MiB large
(compared to 5.4 for multi_v7_defconfig).

For now, I'll send you the version without armadillo support.

Gr{oetje,eeting}s,
