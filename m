Hello.

   Here's the set of 3 patches against Simon Horman's 'renesas.git' repo,
'renesas-devel-v3.16-rc5-20140722' tag. Here we add the USB PHY device tree
support on the R8A7791/Koelsch/Henninger boards. The patchset requires the USB
PHY driver (just re-posted) in order to work.

[1/3] ARM: shmobile: r8a7791: add USB PHY DT support
[2/3] ARM: shmobile: koelsch: enable USB PHY
[3/3] ARM: shmobile: henninger: enable USB PHY

WBR, Sergei
