Simon,

Your emails are somewhat confusing, in that you have to: a handful of people
individually, but not arm@kernel.org. It's clearer that you want us to merge
this pull request if you do to: arm@kernel.org and keep the FYI recipients on
cc.


Now, about this branch: There's not a single review by anyone on the
drivers/bus pieces, nor on the binding. Please collect some, especially since
simple-bus is used by so many.
