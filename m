I think we need to discuss _when_ to do this in more detail. I know
this follows the same style as Laurent's patches, but I don't think
we're ready to flip the switch yet. I propose that we let DT reference
coexist with multiplatform and non-multiplatform cases for a while to
make testing easier and give time to migrate.
