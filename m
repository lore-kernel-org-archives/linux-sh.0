	Hi Simon, Magnus,

This patch series add minimal L1 and L2 cache descriptions to DT for
r8a7740 and sh73a0, and migrates the shmobile DT-based generic r8a7740
platform from calling l2x0_of_init() to the generic l2c OF
initialization.

Note that the conversion to the generic l2c OF initialization is not
done yet for sh73a0, as this initializes the L2 cache earlier, breaking
the (fragile) sh73a0 secondary CPU bringup code.

Also note that this conversion should be done on r8a7778, and r8a7779,
too.

Changes compared to v4 ("[PATCH v4 0/6] ARM: shmobile: r8a7740/sh73a0 DT
Cache Handling",
http://lists.infradead.org/pipermail/linux-arm-kernel/2015-May/340636.html):
  - Drop optional cache-{size,sets,{block,line}-size} properties, as
    this information is auto-detected (I verified this for both L1 and
    L2 cache properties),
  - Merge the L1 patches into the L2 patches, as the only part left from
    the L1 patches was adding the links from CPU to L2 cache nodes.

Changes compared to v3 ("[PATCH v3 0/6] ARM: l2c / shmobile: r8a7740 :
Shared Override",
http://lists.infradead.org/pipermail/linux-arm-kernel/2015-May/340636.html):
  - "l2c: Add support for the "arm,shared-override" property" was split
    off into an independent patch, and is now queued for v4.3 in
    arm/for-next,
  - Dropped armadillo legacy migration, as it no longer exists,
  - Added sh73a0 L1 and L2 DT cache description.

Changes compared to v2 ("[PATCH v2 0/5] ARM: shmobile: r8a7740/armadillo:
Migrate to generic l2c OF",
http://www.spinics.net/lists/devicetree/msg68176.html):
  - Add DT support for Shared Override,
  - Setting Shared Override is done only if CMA is not available (as
    Russell claims it's not needed if CMA is available),
  - Use 0/~0 in machine_desc.l2c_aux_{val,mask}, as DT now supports
    "arm,shared-override".

Changes compared to v1:
  - Fix interrupt reference in DT,
  - Describe L2 better in DT,
  - Keep only {,~}L2C_AUX_CTRL_SHARED_OVERRIDE in
    machine_desc.l2c_aux_{val,mask}, as there's no DT property for
    this.
  - Add L1 cache to DT.

Dependencies:
  - This series applies to renesas-devel-20151123-v4.4-rc2,
  - Patch 3 depends on patch 1,
  - Patch 4 depends on patch 3.

Given C code changesets depending on DT changesets in the same branch
are frowned upon, you may want to postpone patches 3 and 4 to v4.6.
Of course I'll sleep better if you just apply all 4 of them now ;-)

I've been running this on r8a7740/armadillo and sh73a0/kzm9g for more
than a year.

Thanks for applying!
