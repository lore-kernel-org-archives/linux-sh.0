I want the structure to make sense and be consistent so that anyone
who works with a lot of platforms knows where to find stuff and can
work on all the platforms. Simplicity sometimes trumps consistency,
but both are important.

The r8a7779 SoC is indeed an interesting case, it seems to fit
well into shmobile because you use some of the same devices (e.g.
sh-sci and the clock code). If you think there are lots of
commonalities with the new one, it's probably fair to put them
in the same directory even when that means we also have completely
unrelated stuff in there now. I would still prefer having separate
directories, but I'll leave it up to you as long as you put
an explanation about the history into the changeset comment.

One thing is I really don't like is when I get the impression that
people are trying to cheat and hide important facts from the upstream
maintainer in order to improve their chance of getting stuff included.
The best way to avoid giving that impression is to add as much
information as possible about why you do things in a certain way.

We're heading that way for 64 bit ARM, but it needs more work. When
all drivers (irqchip, clock, pinctrl, ...) have been moved out of arch/arm,
I guess a lot of simple platforms become a single source file with just
one DT_MACHINE_START statement (or something even simpler), and then
we can put them into a common directory.
