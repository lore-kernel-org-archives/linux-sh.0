Subject: [PATCH] ARM: Fix memblock_reserve() to include stext

This fix for the ARM architecture will include stext
in the memblock_reserve() call to make sure that the
following symbols are not overwritten (from System.map):

c0008000 T _text
c0008000 T stext
...
c0008138 T secondary_startup
...
c0009000 T _stext

With this patch applied CPU Hotplug starts working
again. Without this patch code in secondary_startup
never gets reached as expected.

This issue started triggering on kernels later than
v3.10 - perhaps a side effect of the CPU Hotplug init
section rework - so this is a fix for v3.11-rc.

Tested on the sh73a0 KZM9G board with CPU Hotplug:

 # echo 0 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu1/online
 CPU1: shutdown
 # echo 1 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu1/online
 CPU1: Booted secondary processor
