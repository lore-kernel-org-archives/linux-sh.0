Added later, but yes.

It does, yes. Driver code should be always be calling clk_enable before using 
a clock, regardless of the implementation (which it shouldn't have to care 
abut), and should abort their initialisation if the clk_enable() fails.

Some clocks are always running, so the enable op will be empty. This is not an 
error, so the driver is free to continue.

Sounds like useless boilerplate - it's not an error to not need 
enable/disable, so I don't see why we need to add extra effort to handle this 
case.

It'd be nice to remove this from the header, but this means we'll need extern 
prototypes in clkdev.c. Might be a reasonable compromise though.

Yep, will unify these (and spell "possibly" correctly :) )
