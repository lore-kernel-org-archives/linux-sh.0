In my SuperH experience, CPG clock divier has same pattern.
In H2's SDCKCR register, SDHFC and SD0FC looks different.
But, the real different is only enabled bit area,
the value is same.
You can find same pattern on FRQCRB register too,
and, you can find same pattern on M2.

I guess FRQCRB/SDHFC can share code if it has mask.
This idea was used on R-Mobile series on div4.
(ex clock-sh73a0.c :: div4_clks)

Do you think we can use this idea on DT?
like this ?

	div4_sdh {
                compatible = "renesas,cpg-clocks-1/x";
                renesas,clock-divider-mask = 0xdff;
                ...
	}

Best regards
