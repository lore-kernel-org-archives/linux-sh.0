I don't know what you mean by this. It is possible to use the same pin for
GPIO and a certain device at the same time even, since this may be possible
in hardware (e.g. to use a GPIO to "spy" on a device line).

Also define what you mean by "gpio-mode", as can be seen from
Documentation/pinctrl.txt section "GPIO mode pitfalls" this is a
dangerously ambigous term.

What do you mean by "manually" here? That is a very unclear term that
I prefer that we do not use at all in the kernel. There is no man inside
the system.

Hm I might understand what a "default no-driver state" is but ... sorry
I have a hard time following this paragraph :-/

What is an "odd pin hog"?

I don't understand what you mean by this, but I guess you're after
som driver intrinsic detail so let's see the patch so we can see
clearly what you mean here.

It makes sense if the HW has two knobs: one for setting pull up
and one for setting the pin into High-Z.

If it has only one or the other, there is not much it can do anyway.

They may be orthogonal in the hardware register sense, i.e. you
can turn on both at the same time by setting two bits, but still they are
not orthogonal in the electrical sense, because the outcome is
ambigous. What happens if you enable both at the same time
must be understood by reading the HW documentation or talking
to the HW engineer who implemented it.

OK I'm following. How do you plan to implement this?

As no such hardware exist this is a question relating to the
ideal world.

Bringing such mental figures into the resoning invokes Plato's
metaphor of the Cave and the debate between philosophical idealism
and philisophical realism.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idealism
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_realism
This relates to mathematical formalism vs. Platonism and whether
our mental models are inventions or discoveries.

I don't know such stuff! All I want to do is manage this subsystem
for the set of pin controllers out there and close the necessary
gaps to make it useful in practice. This is called pragmatism.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pragmatism

So let's keep a pragmatic stance - rough consensus and running
code.

The documentation should say, else I think you should ask a renesas
HW engineer about that. I don't know how that hardware will react
to some of these settings...

What are the two APIs you're referring to here? Pinctrl and
GPIO?

Since both aspects are joined in the subsystem and even in the
same driver file (I think) it is perfectly possible to handle this
in the PFC driver.

From a DT code parsing point of view I think both are OK?

I think the best approach is that the driver check both current
and requested state in the .pin_config_set() callback.

You need to know this first before developing code for
driving the hardware.

The framework does not constrain which version you use, and
any hard constraints should probably be in the driver.

Maybe the generic pinconf core could print warnings about
strange configurations though, maybe as a debug option?

> Up to now I've been viewing configs as being applied one-at-a-time,

They are *not* applied one-at-a-time. The driver is given an
array of configs and can inspect this array and take decisions
on whether it is possible to satisfy this config and in case it
cannot it may return an error code.

So don't use such ancient codebase, I'm developing v3.14 now.

As mentioned this is for the driver to handle.

Please elaborate with an example what you mean by this.
