Subject: [PATCH] ARM: shmobile: Remove FSF address from copyright headers
Message-Id: <335204dfb83b3105cf4a666d1ad024917831cbdc.1414629163.git.horms+renesas@verge.net.au>

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
To: linux-arm-kernel@lists.infradead.org

From: Laurent Pinchart <laurent.pinchart+renesas@ideasonboard.com>

The information is already included in the COPYING file in the kernel
sources root directory, we don't want to modify all source files when
the FSF will move to a new address, and I'm tired of seeing the related
checkpatch.pl warnings.
