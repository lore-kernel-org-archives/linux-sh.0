As a matter of fact there are, especially for those genpds that has
been created through DT as in this case. The API to use is
of_genpd_get_from_provider() to find the struct generic_pm_domain.

Yes, I do realize that you need to manage the parsing of the domain
name to make sure it's the one you want, but I would rather keep that
"hack" in this driver than in the generic API.

Well, who knows *when* that is going to happen. :-)
