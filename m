Sorry. I'll add you on the whole series. It will be a big one, though,
as it will contain the other docbook conversions on it (~50+ patches).

Ah! Ok, I updated the patch (see enclosed). Would that be OK for you?

At least the patches that touch at Documentation/* should go, IMHO,
via a single tree:
	git://git.lwn.net/linux.git docs-next

As Jon mentioned, he doesn't rebase it, so you should be able to get an
immutable branch from it.


Thanks,

[PATCH] mtdnand.rst: group the "::" with previous line

Group the :: with the previous paragraph, in order to make it
visually better when reading as a text file.

While here, replace:
	ored (with means "Covered or adorned with ore or metal")
by:
	OR-ed

To reflect its true meaning.
