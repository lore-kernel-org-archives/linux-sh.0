Hello,

This is a repost of the arch patches from the "[PATCH v3 0/8] Renesas R-Car
Gen2 Common Clock Framework support" patch series. The first three patches in
that series have been reposted separately in the "[PATCH v4 0/3] Renesas R-Car
Gen2 Common Clock Framework drivers" series to get merged through Mike
Turquette's tree, while this series will go through the ARM SoC tree.

I've asked Mike to provide a stable branch when merging the CCF driver
patches.
