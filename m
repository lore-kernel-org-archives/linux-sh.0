This is why I've said (in the parent thread) that I'm not happy to
apply this patch.  Mark Rutland has indicated that he has MCPM cases
where the CPUs which can be disabled changes dynamically according
to the secure firmware requirements, and ripping out todays
infrastructure in light of that, only to have to add it back again
later makes no sense.

However, cleaning things up by removing unnecessary cpu_disable
methods is a good thing to do irrespective of that.
