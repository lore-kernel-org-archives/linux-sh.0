Beucase my experience just tells me that people tend to use whatever
they find and name fits what they think they need.

I would just keep it close to its users. If that is a single arch
generic place then only better. But I suspect some arches have special
requirements.

It's been some time since I've checked the last time. Some arches were
using GPF_REPEAT (__GFP_RETRY_MAYFAIL) back then. I have removed most of
those but some were doing a higher order allocations so they probably
have stayed.
