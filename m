If you are adding the devices in a later patch of the same series, it's
probably better to leave it like it is. I would just like to avoid having
dead code in a release if you don't get around to also add the devices.

Yes, I just need to produce a new version based on 3.9-rc.

I don't want to get new patches during the merge window, but we can
arrange a branch in the arm-soc tree that has both changes merged
and the cleanup on top. We always send out pull requests for 10 to
15 branches in the merge window, and the later branches can be based
on the earlier ones to deal with dependencies like this.

In this particular case, it would also not hurt to do the cleanup
in 3.11, since the patch is only cosmetic.
