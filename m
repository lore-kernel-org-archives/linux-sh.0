I have tentatively queued up patch 1 as a driver change for v4.5
with Greg's Ack. I plan to send a pull request to the ARM SoC maintainers
some time this week.

I have tentatively queued these up on top of patch 1 as sh changes for v4.5.
I intend to send a pull request to Linus once patch 1 hits his tree
via the ARM SoC tree. If all goes well that will likely be in v4.5-rc1 or rc2.

I have tentatively queued up the ARM patches up as (ARM) cleanup
patches for v4.5 and the ARM64 patch as ARM64 cleanup patches for v4.5.
They are based on patch 1. I plan to send a pull request for them
to the ARM SoC maintainers later this week.

I have queued these up in cleanup rather than the dt arm64-dt branches as
they have dependencies not already present there (patch 1) and at this
stage of the merge-cycle I would like to keep the dt branches as simple as
possible.

I have tentatively queued this up as a driver change for v4.6 with
Greg's Ack. I plan to send a pull request to the ARM SoC maintainers
after rebasing on v4.5-rc1 or rc2 assuming that patch 1 is present there.

Can you confirm that patch 16 only depends on patch 2?


I have not queued up the h8300 patch. I believe that one is for Sato-san.
