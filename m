CodingStyle says: "if there is a clear reason for why it under certain
circumstances might be an "unsigned int" and under other configurations
might be "unsigned long", then by all means go ahead and use a typedef."

In our case the DSI transactions and DCS commands are always 6 and 8
bits, so I don't think it applies.

And the transaction datatypes and DCS commands are really just payload
sent to the peripheral, and the peripheral can do anything it wants with
those.

But wouldn't a typedef basically lock the possible transactions or DCS
commands that you can give to the functions? And that was the original
problem also.

Why they cannot be? I don't see any technical problem there, at least.
And while I don't have any current use to extend transactions, I
wouldn't want to limit it for any possible future use either.

That's true. I guess you've gotten it easy, if you only have DSI video
mode panels that do not need any special care =). Command mode panels
are usually slightly more complex, and especially early prototypes of
the panels can require quite a lot of trickery. And then there are DSI
hubs, which make DSI command mode panels look trivial...
