For slave DMA drivers, there is the expectation that the prepare
functions will be callable from tasklet context, without any locks
held by the driver.  So, it's expected that the prepare functions
will work from tasklet context.

I don't think we've ever specified whether they should be callable
from interrupt context, but in practice, we have drivers which do
exactly that, so I think the decision has already been made - they
will be callable from IRQ context, and so GFP_ATOMIC is required
in the driver.

Right, runtime PM with DMA engine drivers is hard.  The best that can
be done right now is to pm_runtime_get() in the alloc_chan_resources()
method and put it in free_chan_resources() if you don't want to do the
workqueue thing.

There's a problem with the workqueue thing though - by doing so, you
make it asynchronous to the starting of the DMA.  The DMA engine API
allows for delayed starting (it's actually the normal thing for DMA
engine), but that may not always be appropriate or desirable.

As I mention above, the problem with that is getting the workqueue to
run soon enough that it doesn't cause a performance degredation or
other issues.

There's also expectations from other code - OMAP for example explicitly
needs DMA to be started on the hardware before the audio block can be
enabled (from what I remember, it tickless an erratum if this is not
done.)

IRQs-off contexts. :)
