Agree, except it is not a "device" choice but a platform choice. In other words,
having a host bridge capable of running on multi-host-bridge setups, then
your HB driver will have to mandate "linux,pci-domain" presence. But the decision
to have more than one HB will be present in the device tree, not in the driver.

Agree, and the DT will pin down the domain numbers.

Maybe because I have confused you. Let's try again:
  - of_pci_get_domain_nr(): function present in v11, parses "pci-domain" alias,
    allocates a new domain number if "pci-domain" info is missing. Will be
    removed in v12.
  - of_get_pci_domain_nr(): subtle change of name to flag the change of behaviour
    from the previous function. Only parses "linux,pci-domain" property of the
    host bridge node, returns the property value as an integer between 0 and 255,
    or a negative value if the property is missing.
  - pci_get_new_domain_nr(): this function is only present in v12 and allocates
    a new domain number each time it is called.

Hope this helps,
