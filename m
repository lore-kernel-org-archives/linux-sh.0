Did you mean two different patches or was the duplication an accident? 
Anyway, thanks for a heads-up! I checked that patch, interesting. At least 
it's conflicting with this patch from Magnus:

"ARM: shmobile: Register DT TWD from timer.c"
https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/2222551/

I know those patches are on a hold, but I was using the one above locally. 
If shmobile_timer_init() is removed, this won't be a huge problem for this 
work, I'll just have to call twd_local_timer_of_register() directly from 
.init_time, but whether these patches are good for upstream at all is 
another question, I'll expand on it a bit in a reply to Simon's mail.

Thanks
Guennadi
