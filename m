Then, how does that function catch a driver that, say, doesn't do clk_prepare
but share the clk with another already active driver?
Because you said - "We're after detecting drivers missing calls to
clk_prepare()"

The point is, there is difference between detecting drivers that miss
the clk_prepare
and ensuring clk_prepare has been called before any call to
clk_enable. And making
that clear helps get rid of lots of confusion/misunderstanding. Uwe
seems to have
had similar confusions.

I am not asking what you think.
In my second last post, I am rather asking the other way around - that
let us not worry
about drivers missing the clk_prepare and not try to catch those by the new API.

Exactly.
All we need is to ensure clk_prepare has been called atleast once before
any call to clk_enable.
