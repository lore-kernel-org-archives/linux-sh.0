Hi Laurent

Thanks for your work on this! Sorry for jumping in so late in the game. 
Let's do it this way: I don't think my comments are serious enough to 
enforce a v4. If noone else complains, I'm fine with addressing them in an 
incremental patch. If you get more comments and have to do a v4, you can 
address mine too, otherwise I'm fine with this version going in and 
improving it slightly afterwards.

How should pull up / down be specified? Above you say only "active low" is 
supported so far.

Actually, I'm a bit confused by how pinctrl and GPIO DT nodes should be 
implemented:

In this example you add one node, that implements both - a pinctrl and a 
GPIO controller. However, on some platforms you add two DT nodes: one for 
pinctrl and one for GPIO. While doing that your GPIO node has a compatible 
string like

		compatible = "renesas,gpio-r8a7778", "renesas,gpio-rcar";

Do I understand it right, that a separate DT node is used for a GPIO 
controller if the controllers are really well separated on the hardware, 
probably, don't share register address ranges? Is there a driver in the 
kernel, that actually probes those compatible strings? Or the driver for 
those GPIO controllers isn't DT based? Maybe at least a short explanation 
and an example with two DT nodes here, or a reference to another 
documentation would help.

Not sure, is it really a good idea to use this #ifdef here? I think you 
could drop all 3 of them in this hunk:

and here.

Maybe simpler

+	if (*num_maps)
+		return 0;
+
+	dev_err(dev, "no mapping found in node %s\n", np->full_name);
+	ret = -EINVAL;
+
+done:

+
+	return ret;
