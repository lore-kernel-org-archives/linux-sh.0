We have precedence of optional external clocks (can_clk, audio_clk_*).
The SoC datasheet clearly calls it "scif_clk", so that makes it an ABI, IMHO.

As scif_clk is shared between all (H)SCIF instances, that would mean overriding
the clock and clock-names for all of them, which is quite a tedious task.
Most boards seem to provide a SCIF_CLK, to allow having "perfect" standard
baud rates.

Combined all of the above, I think it's sufficiently generic to keep
it that way.

Note that it's different for (H)SCK: these are per-(H)SCIF inputs, and depend
even more on board layout. Adding individual zero-frequency clock nodes for
them would preclude e.g. connecting all (H)SCK inputs to the same crystal.
Hence I didn't add them, and you do have to override all clocks and
clock-names of a node if you want to add an (H)SCK clock input (been there,
done that for testing; long live DT overlays).
