Subject: GIC_CPU_MASK_SIMPLE(8)" on big.LITTLE?

A while ago, I wondered:

| It's my understanding GIC_CPU_MASK_SIMPLE should reflect the actual number
| of CPU cores the interrupt is wired too. Is that correct?
|
| [Fixes for incorrect masks on shmobile]
|
| Should it be "GIC_CPU_MASK_SIMPLE(8)" on big.LITTLE configurations
| with four Cortex-A15 cores and four Cortex-A7 cores?
| Or should the interrupts be delivered to the four Cortex-A15 cores
| only by default?
|
| Note that incorrect masks for GIC PPI interrupts are not limited to
| shmobile. Presumably the interrupt specifiers got copied around a lot,
| cfr. the proliferation of "GIC_CPU_MASK_SIMPLE(4)" (and the older
| hardcoded "0xf0x" variant) in various dtsi files, not always limited to
| quad-core CPUs.

In the mean time, arch/arm64/boot/dts/arm/juno.dts got added, which has 2 A57
cores and 4 A53 cores, and uses GIC_CPU_MASK_SIMPLE(6), so it seems like
my two RFC patches to use GIC_CPU_MASK_SIMPLE(8) for 4 A15 cores and 4
A7 cores are actually correct?

Thanks for your comments!
