I see that Laruent has taken patch 1/4.

Is it possible for me to merge patches 2-4/4 independently of that patch?
That is, can I apply them and still produce a kernel that boots. If so,
that is my preferred option. If not I will talk to Laurent about a branch
to base things on.

Also, I would like to get an Ack from Magnus.
