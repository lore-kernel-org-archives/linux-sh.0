Yes, I tested this in 1-bit and 4-bit mode. At least the card claims it is using it,
it says "width=2". I also read about the toggling, and expected to do
something fancy, but when tests where successful I came to the conclusion
that the controller does the toggling for us. Do you believe otherwise?

I quick grep shows that nobody seems to care about this bit until now...

Thanks,
