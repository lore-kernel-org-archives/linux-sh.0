Is it best to copy these functions to each arch, or would it be better
to have a shared file from which these functions could be pulled for
multiple archs? I wasn't sure when I wrote decompress_unxz.c, which is
why I put the extra functions there as a temporary solution.

These already have memcpy. It can save a few bytes if one reused
memmove as memcpy when using XZ compression. I got a difference of 48
bytes on x86_64.

Adding memmove to string.c on x86 means that memmove is included in the
kernel image even when memmove isn't needed. With gzip compression I
got 128 bytes bigger image on x86_64 after adding the unneeded memmove
to string.c.

I don't know if those size increases matter in practice.
