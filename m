Tree management side note: to apply this I've created a new 
tip:locking/nmi branch, which is based off the existing NMI vs. IRQ 
tracing commits included in locking/core:

ed00495333cc: ("locking/lockdep: Fix TRACE_IRQFLAGS vs. NMIs")
ba1f2b2eaa2a: ("x86/entry: Fix NMI vs IRQ state tracking")
859d069ee1dd: ("lockdep: Prepare for NMI IRQ state tracking")
248591f5d257: ("kcsan: Make KCSAN compatible with new IRQ state tracking")
e1bcad609f5a: ("Merge branch 'tip/x86/entry'")
b037b09b9058: ("x86/entry: Rename idtentry_enter/exit_cond_rcu() to idtentry_enter/exit()")
dcb7fd82c75e: ("Linux 5.8-rc4")

This locking/nmi branch can then be merged into irq/entry (there's a 
bunch of conflicts between them), without coupling all of v5.9's 
locking changes to Thomas's generic entry work.

Thanks,

	Ingo
