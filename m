Hi Guennadi, hi Simon,

yes somehow a chunk is missing from my original patch in the patch of
the next branch that got merged from soc2. I've prepared a revert of
the bad patch and a corrected version, but now I'm unsure if that
helps at all. Finally you don't want to get that fixups pulled into
the mainline.

It seems to me to be a real mess to correct some patch somewhere in
the middle of merged patch stacks. If I can help Simon, please let me
know.

Cheers,

 Bastian
