I am currently planning to apply this patch to the soc branch
of the renesas tree as Magnus's "[PATCH 00/04] ARM: shmobile: r8a73a4 SoC
support V3" series depends on it and I'd rather not block that series.

I realise that this patch is a temporary fix. A more permanent
solution can be based on top of it.
