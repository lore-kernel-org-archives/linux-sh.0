Hi Catalin,
yes, already working on it. As suggested by others, I'll move pm_power_off
to a central location (no need to declare the same variable for each
architecture) and hide the call to it in do_kernel_poweroff() as a
first step. You'll see this in the next version of the series.
This will make it much easier to remove it later on.

Thanks,
Guenter
