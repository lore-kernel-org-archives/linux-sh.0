Hi Olof, Hi Kevin, Hi Arnd,

Please consider these second round of Renesas ARM based SoC clock updates for v3.17.

This pull request is based on the previous round of
such requests, tagged as renesas-clock-for-v3.17,
which you have already pulled into next/soc.

CCF support for the SoCs in question is being worked on,
so I expect this code to be a temporary measure.


The following changes since commit edc8fb1d6ebdfc4efa009073586d3567c3368475:

  ARM: shmobile: sh73a0: add SCI clock support for DT (2014-07-12 15:15:39 +0200)

----------------------------------------------------------------
Second Round of Renesas ARM Based SoC Clock Updates for v3.17

* Add legacy clocks for SCI for SoCs that do not yet have CCF support.
  This is to allow SCI (serial) devices to be enabled using DT and
  will be removed after CCF support is added for each SoC.
