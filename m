Ok, I'm dropping this patch from the series then.

I've done it for all the defconfig files for now, which probably covers
most of the drivers that are relevant on ARM. I still have a backlog
of unrelated warning fixes from that. Once I'm done with those, I'm planning
to do another round of randconfig builds, which hopefully catches the
rest. I'll just exclude drivers/sh from those builds for now.
