We do not change initcall ordering around unless there is a reason to do
so, as it's assumed that a given initcall has been chosen for a reason.
You have hit upon a bug or at least something timing related causing you
a delay and so have elected to push it down a level. That is of course
fine, but none of that is anywhere in your commit text leaving us to try
and figure out what exactly the point of this exercise is.

Usually "because everyone else is doing it" and another driver is not,
there's a reason for that driver doing things differently. There are
certainly enough cases where initcall and link ordering is strongly
ordered for a reason that cosmetic/janitorial fixes are best rejected out
of hand.

You had a reason, great. Next time put it in your commit text.
