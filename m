OK, but this also assumes you want *every* clock associated with a
device node managed by runtime PM.  Is that really what you want?  

I may have misunderstood, but your previous attempts at solving this
problem suggest you wanted finer grained control over which device
clocks are runtime PM managed and which ones arent.
