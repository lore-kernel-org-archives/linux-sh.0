What's the benefit of adding a string here if the driver doesn't check
for it?  Since the driver doesn't look for it, there's no way to test
anything.

It doesn't seem like this file is an authoritative source of names, so
if we add it here, there's the possibility the r8a7793 will be
canceled or renamed, and then we'd have to update this if the driver
ever did need an r8a7793-specific quirk.  If we waited until the
driver actually needs a quirk, then we'd know exactly what name to
look for and we could update the driver, DT, and doc all together.
