I assume, you mean adding a new flag to skip ioremap(). But then we have 
to pass the virtual address to the function. Its prototype is

int dma_declare_coherent_memory(struct device *dev, dma_addr_t bus_addr,
				dma_addr_t device_addr, size_t size, int flags);

bus_addr is unused in this case, but I don't think abusing it to pass a 
"void *" would be an acceptable solution - apart from all the ugly 
type-casting, if we ever get 64-bit virtual addresses on ARM with 32-bit 
DMA addresses, we've got a problem. Or is this never going to happen? Or 
whould I rather add a new function?

Thanks
