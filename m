I do know some farmers who splice trees thought :-)

Yes, I'm one of the refugee Quilt users. Comes in handy when cold too

Normally I get Ingo to pick up the queue 1-2 times a week so latency
shouldn't be too bad. But we just had the merge window and then I got
side-tracked rewriting all atomic implementations.

So usually submit patches against tip/master unless you know there's
other pending bits that conflict, in which case you can grab my queue on
top of tip/master -- but I try to make sure that's usually not needed.
