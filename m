Right, that seems to be missing from the timers. Is there any reason
why we need to treat those in a special way?

In my mind this timer case is similar to various SCIF variants
documented in Documentation/devicetree/bindings/serial/renesas,sci-serial.txt
- in the case of SCIF we have SoC name in the binding documentation.
