Sorry, I must be missing something. I'm basing my patches on the current 
(of yesterday) next tree, which already contains Linus' patches:

mmc: tmio_mmc: use dmaengine helpers, drop submit check
mmc: tmio_mmc: drop dma_sglen state variable
mmc: tmio_mmc: unmap with the proper sglen
mmc: tmio_mmc: map DMA buffers on the DMA engine device

or which his patches do you mean?

Thanks
Guennadi
