Subject: [PATCH/RFC] ARM: shmobile: dts: Add common file for MSIOF1

From: Hisashi Nakamura <hisashi.nakamura.ak@renesas.com>

The R-Car Gen 2 SoCs have MSIOF1 interfaces however they
are not exposed on any boards currently supported in mainline.

The purpose of r8a77xx-msiof1.dtsi is to be included
in a dts file if MSIOF1 is exposed by some means.

[horms: Reworked into a separate dtsi file]
