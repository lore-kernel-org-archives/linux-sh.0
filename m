As we have circular dependencies forward declaration can't be avoided. I found 
it cleaner to have devices data in registration order in the board file, but I 
can remove this if you prefer.

If both the transmitter and LCDC drivers are built-in, the device probe order 
is the device registration order. As we need the transmitter to be probed 
first, it needs to be registered first.
