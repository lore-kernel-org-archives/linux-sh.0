I would disagree.

As I have said in past, we need the mapping information to be available
with dmaengine for slave channels even before any slave allocation
occurs. This way dmaengine knows what to do with a channel.
I am planning to add the support in dmanegine for this...

The problem with this solution here is again how the hell will a dmac
know what to do with alloc request. It doesn't and any current way it
does is just a hack and nothing else. This also prevenrts us form
building genric dmac driver which should only know how to deal with dmac
only and nothing else.
