Subject: [PATCH v6 00/17] ARM: shmobile: r8a7779, marzen: CCF and multiplatform

The aim of this series is to add common clock framework and in turn
multiplatform support to the r8a7779 SoC and marzen-reference.  It
subsequently removes non-multiplatform support from marzen-reference.

This is based on work for R-Car Gen2 by Laurent Pinchart and Magnus Damm.


This series is a minor update to v5 to take into account:
* An Ack
* Request for caching of the pin mode
* Patches that have been queued up for v3.16

I intend to merge this series unless there are objections.


Applied on top of a merge of:
* The renesas-devel-v3.15-rc1-20140515 tag of my renesas tree.
* The clk-next branch of Mike Turquettes's tree
  This is to provide the following which were previously part of this series:
  - clk: shmobile: r8a7779: Add MSTP clock support
  - clk: shmobile: r8a7779: Add clocks support


Caveats:

* SMSC_PHY is known not to work with marzen though the reason for
  this is not known. As this is selected in the shmobile_defconfig
  it should be manually disabled before compiling that configuration
  for use on Marzen.
