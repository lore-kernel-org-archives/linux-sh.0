Hi Olof, Hi Arnd,

This pull request is based on a merge of renesas-soc-for-v3.11
and renesas-pinmux-for-v3.11 in order to provide pre-requisites.
You have previously pulled both of those tags.

I have put all of these patches into a single pull-request as
R8A7779/Marzen clean-up portion are tightly related and don't seem
to be easily broken out into e.g. board and soc components without
introducing bisection breakage.

This pull request will cause various conflicts though I believe all
of them are not difficult to resolve. The renesas-next-20130613 tag in
my tree illustrates how I have handled the conflicts with
both changes already in arm-soc and changes I intend to send
pull requests for in the near future.

The following changes since commit ae8b378faea7f04d4517b22f5d70d824adcbc4dc:

  Merge branches 'heads/pinmux' and 'heads/soc' into phy-rcar-usb-base (2013-06-11 14:58:57 +0900)
