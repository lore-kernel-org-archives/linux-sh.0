Using braces with case statements is a common practice in the kernel, without 
adding an extra indentation level.

In this particular case I can move the variable declaration at the top of the 
function, as the generated code on ARM (at least with gcc ('cs2009q3-67-hard-
sb4') 4.4.1) doesn't differ.
