It needs to protect against the read_status_mask and ignore_status_mask
being read half-way through an update by the interrupt handler, otherwise
you can end up with god-knows-what coming through from each termios
change.

Eg, you could see an effective CREAD flip when the state of CREAD wasn't
actually changed.
