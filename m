Ok, can do that.

I believe, this your comment refers to another related patch of mine:

[RFC][PATCH] add dma_reserve_coherent_memory()/dma_free_reserved_memory() API

Sure, updating the documentation would be the right thing to do here, but 
FUJITA Tomonori is nacking this patch for 2.6.36, so, we will either have 
to live with a few broken platforms and drivers until 2.6.37, or we'll 
have to find another solution, or that NAK has to be reconsidered

Right, sorry, added to the CC now, although, this is not the right thread 
to discuss the proposed new API.

Thanks
