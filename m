Yes, that is the correct approach.

Right, there is no need to change the code for that, but I think it
makes sense to do the binding the way you describe, in case someone
later wants to move to platform_get_irq_byname. A lot of people prefer
that for some reason, although I think the traditional numbering is
just as good.

I meant the absolute frequency in HZ, since that is what we do
for the 8250 uart and other devices, but only if that is sufficient
for your device.
