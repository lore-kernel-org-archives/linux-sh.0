Lucas,

In testing this on IMX6 I'm finding that 'of_irq_parse_and_map_pci()'
always returns -EINVAL because it can't find a dt node for the host
bridge: http://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/drivers/of/of_pci_irq.c#n60.

So it seems there is still something missing in the imx6 devicetree
regarding a 'host bridge'?  Is this solution expecting the
range/interrupt data from the PCI host controller to be encapsulated
in a host-bridge node such as
http://lxr.missinglinkelectronics.com/linux/Documentation/devicetree/bindings/pci/ralink,rt3883-pci.txt#L124?
 If so, thats not how the imx6 host controller node is currently
defined.

In my particular test case I have a baseboard with a socket on it and
a PLX PEX860x PCIe switch on an add-in card.  So I don't think it
makes sense to me to describe the add-in card in the baseboard DT -
that wouldn't be very plug-n-play.   By the way, I'm not referring to
the add-in card with the TI-XIO2001 PCIe-to-PCI bridge with the
mismapped IRQ's - I'm aware that I would need to deal with that
somehow in devicetree (still trying to understand how).

Thanks,

Tim
