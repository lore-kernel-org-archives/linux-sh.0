IMHO, Patch 1-3 are ready and can either be merged through the MMC
or one of Paul's trees. Although I should note that patches
2 and 3 include changes to arch/arm/boot/compressed/mmcif-sh7372.c and
arch/sh/boot/romimage/mmcif-sh7724.c.

Please wait on 4, which depends on 1-3, and I would like to do
one more round of testing. In any case it'll most likely need to go
through RMK's tree.

I do not currently have any plans to revise patches 1-3.

1-3 include MMC changes but only patch 1 includes TMIO changes.

I am happy for either my patches to go in first or for me to re-base them
on top of yours. I'm also happy for you to re-base my patches (1 or 1-3)
and include them in a patchset if that works for you.
