The only two boards where we today boot from the reset vector and
actually need to provide this information to the kernel are Mackerel
and AP4EVB.

My approach with this series was more to make sure all boards keep on
working regardless what their boot loader pass. This since I too do
not trust the boot loader - especially on older boards. Perhaps the
more acceptable approach is to pretend to start trusting the
information by the boot loader and deal with the fallout if that
happens. Things may break when removing CONFIG_MEMORY_START/SIZE since
the MEM_SIZE and PHYS_OFFSET change in arch/arm/kernel/atags_parse.c

Anyway I can update my romImage series so it uses appended DTB with
both AP4EVB and Mackerel. Then this series can simply be thrown away.

Yeah, I agree with your idea but I wonder about the timing. Actually,
I was thinking that the prime candidate boards for multiplatform are
our DT -reference boards. Still blocked on common clock framework
though... I will try to sort out the memory bits first.

Thanks,
