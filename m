Subject: [PATCH] ARM: CONFG_FORCE_MAX_ZONEORDER update for SH-Mobile ARM

Allow SH-Mobile ARM users to adjust FORCE_MAX_ZONEORDER.

The Kconfig entry is taken from SH and non-4K page size
stuff has been trimmed away. For now only SH-Mobile ARM is
allowed to change this variable, SA1111 configs are kept at
"9" and the rest at "11".

CONFIG_FORCE_MAX_ZONEORDER lets the user tweak the maximum
amount of physically contiguous memory that can be alloced by
the kernel.

 A previous version that modified arch/arm/mach-shmobile/Kconfig
 was yesterday posted to linux-sh@vger.kernel.org as

 "[PATCH 02/05] ARM: mach-shmobile: Add CONFIG_FORCE_MAX_ZONEORDER"

 I did however receive feedback that this change is more suitable
 for general consumption in arch/arm/Kconfig. Hopefully this change
 is acceptable as-is by the ARM community.

 Let me know if you want me to rework things. Thank you!

 Built on top of linux-next 20100512.
