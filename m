Ah, gotcha, and also noticing my own slight confusion here.

First, since there's no overlap with the old and the new branch,
there's no need to base them on each other (since they won't cause
merge conflicts, and order of merging them in doesn't have other
dependencies either).

But it also makes sense from your development point of view to stack
them, since that's how you'll end up building up the branches anyway.
So:

Nah, no need, sorry for the confusion. I'll pull it in as it is into next/soc.
