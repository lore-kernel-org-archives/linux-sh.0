Thanks for checking, but we're not making use of earlyprintk on
r8a73a4. So adding this parameter will not make any difference, just
potential confusion IMO.

On r8a73a4 the SCIF ports are added as regular device drivers at
->init_machine() timing. With this approach transition to DT in the
future will be just a small step.

Thanks,
