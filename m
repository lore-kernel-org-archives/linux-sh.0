Now that we have split things out in to regtype for the compat string we
may be able to get away with selecting defaults that match the regtype
and drop it from the binding (assuming all future parts remain relatively
sane), but it would still complicate things if we were to ever do DT
support for legacy CPUs. It's not enough to tie to the port type, as
there are plenty of cases where the port type uses a non-standard algo on
some CPU subtypes (although things are pretty consistent for the arm side
so far).
