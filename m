Thanks for your patch. I'm not sure if I 100% agree with the change
above, but it may be correct depending on what is expected of the TWD
driver.

In mach-shmobile we have a couple of Cortex-A9 SoCs with one or more
CPU cores. What I can tell by the Linux TWD driver only SMP operation
is supported. This seems different from the Cortex-A15/A7 architected
timer that also supports UP mode.

We use our Renesas-specific timers for single core and multi core
operation and opt-in with local timers when those are enabled by the
kernel configuration and DT and/or C support code. TWD is used in
SMP-mode only today. If possible I'd also like to use the TWD for UP
operation on the Cortex-A9 single core SoCs, but the above change is
not really aligned with that. Perhaps my expectation is too high, I'm
not sure.

Has anyone use TWD with single core Cortex-A9 or multi-core Cortex-A9
in UP mode? Is there a software or hardware limitation why it can't be
used with a single mode?

Cheers,
