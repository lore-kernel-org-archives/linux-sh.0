(a) you need to read other discussions on this subject which have already
been had on linux-arm-kernel.  Essentially I've had it in the neck for
less than 128 bytes of needless bloat.  So when I'm faced with 8K of
bloat, what do you think my reaction will be?  Roll over and capitulate
only to get it in the neck again?  Or come up with an easy solution?

(b) that's effectively what it is - if you understand what's going on with
the 'default' statements.

For any option, there can be multiple 'default' statements:

- default value: "default" <expr> ["if" <expr>]
  A config option can have any number of default values. If multiple
  default values are visible, only the first defined one is active.
...
  Optionally, dependencies only for this default value can be added with
  "if".

Now, because of that well defined order, if we do this:

config FOO
	int
	default 1024 if A
	default 512 if B
	default 256

Then we end up with this truth table:

A B FOO
n n 256
n y 512
y n 1024
y y 1024

Which - provided the order is highest value first - gets us the highest
value for this variable dependent on which platforms have been selected.

And - given that we don't have many which require this treatment, this
is a sane solution to the problem.  Not only that but it's one which can
be trivially deleted from one file if and when we have sparse gpio.
