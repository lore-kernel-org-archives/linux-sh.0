Sad to see all our hard work being deleted. But at the same
time its nice to be able to reduce our footprint by 8681 lines!

I have queued up the first 12 patches of this series, that is the
non-pfc patches. They are queued up in a new sh7372-soc-removal-for-v3.21
branch which I intend to push as part of renesas-devel-20150127-v3.19-rc6 a
little later today.

With regards to the PFC patches, the last two patches in the series, I have
spoken with Laurent about this and my understanding is that his feeling
is that they could be merged independently by the pinctl maintainer, Linus
Walleij.

Laurent, if that is correct could see about working with Linus towards
that goal? If not, please let me know and we can work out another plan.
