As I mentioned in the other email, you need use APMU as part of MCPM
platform ops. You still need APMU DT node and all the necessary
functions to access it. I said only 'cpus' property in DT node is
unnecessary and the way its used.

Good.

Again I am not sure if you want to avoid supporting PSCI. I understand
it needs secure firmware but that's unavoidable if any of the CPU PM
functionality on that hardware is accessible only in secure mode and you
are running Linux in non-secure mode.
