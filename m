Sorry, I'm not sure how best to describe it, and I don't have sufficient 
information myself. In any case on a block-diagram of sh73a0 SDHI devices 
aren't directly connected to a common super-highway bus, instead they are 
on a bus-splitter. One more thing I forgot to mention - this error has 
been observed on SMP.

No, don't think highmem was involved.

I checked clock code under drivers/sh/clk, I don't see any relevant 
__raw_* operations there. One I do see, however, GIC code does use 
*_relaxed() accessors, but under raw spinlocks... Do those provide 
sufficient barriers?
