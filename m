True, but in trying to test upstream kernels, initramfs was easier than
fighting with device drivers (although now I've just switched to using
memory mapped mtd-rom).

Yes, there were multiple things wrong that took me a while to find, but
once you get them all working, it's pretty cool. Note, the Kconfig
issues are going to be a bit harder to get approval.

So I've noticed. As far as I can tell, the XIP kernel stuff broke years
ago.

I guess then the parts of the kernel that refer to section locations
need to be looked at again. As you can see from my other patches,
there's a bit of miss-match that I was trying to align.


So at this point...I'm assume all my XIP 'hacks' are being rejected.

As for making a new XIP-only linker script, note that I really only
work with the ARMv7. I know the M4 and M5 guys do XIP_KERNEL builds,
but I've got no way of testing their XIP_KERNEL builds or knowing
what will break.
