It makes sense with the explanation.

I think some of the patches should be clarified to mention BRG-EC (or whatever 
you want to call it) instead of just BRG, as otherwise it's very easy to 
confuse the two BRGs. The (H)SCK clock is an input to the internal BRG, while 
the SCIF_CLK and INT_CLK are inputs to the BRG-EC. Without clarification the 
DT bindings and the code can be hard to understand.
