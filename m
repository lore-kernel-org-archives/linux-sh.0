Some time ago I started a discussion about the need for a proper early device
probing mechanism[1]. One that would be based on real platform drivers and
support both platform data and device tree.

While we're far from reaching any consensus on the implementation, Arnd
suggested that I start off by moving the SuperH-specific early platform
drivers implementation to arch/sh[2].

This series is the first attempt at making way for a new, less hacky
implementation.

The first patch moves all the early_platform code to arch/sh.

The second patch prefixes all early_platform symbols with 'sh_'.

v1 -> v2:
- certain drivers are compiled for arm/mach-shmobile too - we need to
  add ifdefs for CONFIG_SUPERH around early_platform calls

v2 -> v3:
- added a stub for is_early_platform_device() which always returns false
  on non-SuperH architectures

v3 -> v4:
- rebased on top of v5.4-rc1
- removed patches that are already upstream from the series

  drivers: move the early platform device support to arch/sh
  sh: add the sh_ prefix to early platform symbols
