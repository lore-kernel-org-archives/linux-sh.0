Some SDHI controllers require waiting for the SD bus to become
idle before writing to some registers. This series allows
this to occur by:
	* ensuring all relevant accesses are made via sd_ctrl_write16()
	* Adding a hook to sd_ctrl_write16()
	* Supplying a hook that implements waiting for idle

The series also includes some clean-ups of related code.

The first three patches are intended for the mmc tree
	* [PATCH 1/5] mmc: tmio: name 0xd8 as CTL_DMA_ENABLE
	* [PATCH 2/5] mmc: tmio: Share register access functions
	* [PATCH 3/5] mmc: sdhi: Add write16_hook

The remaining two patches are intended for the rmobile tree
	* [PATCH 4/5] ARM: mach-shmobile: ag5evm: consistently name sdhi info
	* [PATCH 5/5] ARM: mach-shmobile: ag5evm: SDHI requires waiting for

I am not aware of any dependencies on patches outside this series.
Dependencies on patches within the series are noted inline.

This is v2 of this patch series, issues addressed since v1 are
all in [PATCH 3/5] mmc: sdhi: Add write16_hook:
	* Include linux/delay.h instead of asm/delay.h
	* Skip write if sh_mobile_sdhi_wait_idle() times out
	  - The bus will probably be in an inconsistent state and writing
	    may lock up the bus
	* Only set hook if TMIO_MMC_HAS_IDLE_WAIT is set in platform data
	  rather than checking for TMIO_MMC_HAS_IDLE_WAIT each time the
	  hook is called.
