The document lists the acceptable compat strings for the driver.
Some are currently implemented by the driver. Some are not.
This provides a mechanism for enhancing the driver while maintaining
compatibility with existing DT blobs.

The document does not describe the way to order the compat strings, which I
believe is a more generic issue as many drivers have more and less specific
compat strings to describe hardware which is compatible with each other. To
some extent I believe it is up to the user, that is the person writing DT
files, to understand what the hardware they are dealing with is compatible
with. And to some extent I believe the ordering is a best-practice that
ought to be described in a high-level document if it is not already.

Your proposed update assumes that all past and future hardware handled by
current and future versions of the driver will be compatible with
"renesas,sh-mmcif". How can you possibly know that is true?
