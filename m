Hi,

this is a first pass at consolidating the defconfigs of shmobile.

It covers the mackerel, amradillo800eva and kzm9d boards which meet
the following criteria:

* Have the same base memory address (0x40000000).
* Work with RUNTIME_PM, it is desirable to have that a common defconfig
* Are booted via DT, enabling the command line to be supplied in the dts.
  This is important to allow serial console and early printk settings,
  which vary wildly between boards, to be supplied.
* Boards I have to test.
  This didn't eliminate any candidates that met the above criteria.

I believe it should also be possible to add support for the APE6EVM
board to the consolidated defconfig once problems with RUNTIME_PM
have been isolated and resolved. I have send an email about this
in a separate thread "APE6EVM and Runtime PM".

I believe it may be possible to add support for the lager board
to the consolidated defconfig once I am able to bring that board up,
which should be rather soon. The lager board does not currently
have a defconfig.

Morimoto-san, I suspect it may be possible to add support for the
bockw board to the consolidated defconfig if its boot loader supports
booting using a zImage. In this case even though the base memory address
is not the same as the boards above it should be possible to specify
the base address from the boot loader. As I do not have a bockw board
I am wondering if you could investigate this.
