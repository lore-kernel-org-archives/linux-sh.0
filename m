It's not quite that straightforward, you've also killed off the name
attribute for each of the intc sysdevs, so we no longer have a visible
way to map a given intc controller number to the controller name in a
user visible way.

I'm not opposed to the syscore thing for suspend/resume ops, but I'm not
willing to trash the userimask and name mapping interface in the process
with no alternatives.

userimask was the first global configuration item I added, but there are
other per-controller and global configuration knobs that I plan to export
through the interface, so there really needs to be a compelling reason
for moving off of sysdevs.
