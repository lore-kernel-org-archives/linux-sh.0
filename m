In this patch you modify r8a7790_add_standard_devices_dt() to include
clocks. I prefer not to make this kind of modification to the generic
r8a7790 DT code since it clashes with upcoming common clock framework
changes. I would like to keep the generic per-SoC DT_MACHINE bits so
they don't enable legacy clocks.

Also, as you probably noticed, this patch conflicts with the idea to
keep ->init_machine() set to NULL for modern platforms.

Despite what I said yesterday, I think it would be very useful to have
Lager DT reference board code around even though SCIF can't do DT yet.

How about keeping the DT_MACHINE stuff for r8a7790 in setup-r8a7790.c
as-is, but in your board-lager-reference.c you have a temporary
version of ->init_machine() that enables clocks, adds SCIF (and CMT?)
as platform devices, but does the rest via DT? Then when SCIF is ready
we can drop the C code for the DT reference board support.

Cheers,
