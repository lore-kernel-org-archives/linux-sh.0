Having really specific strings to give us the flexibility if necessary
makes sense, so I the addition of the strings below is fine.

I see in the example update the existing "renesas,cmt-48-gen2" string
remains. I take it we expect that as a fallback in the compatible list
for all of the new strings, and the driver can jsut match on that for
the moment?

If so, it would be nice to be more explicit as to what we expect as
fallback compatible entries.

Cheers,
Mark.
