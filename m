Oh, my bad. When I saw the change from <mach/file.h> to "file.h", I missed that
there was no diff move that accompanied it.

We're still talking mostly about code under mach-shmobile though, right?
I think most of these header files are only actually used underneath of there.

If so, then it's fine to just do it in one branch. The rules for how we sort
our branches are guidelines, and where it doesn't make sense to follow them, we
don't. :)

For something like this, that has a build-time possibility to check for
introduced breakage (i.e. no likelihood for some strange random regression at
runtime), I'm OK with the patches coming in late. I.e. there's time for 3.15 if
you want to try getting it in. If not, we can queue it up as a base branch for
any other changes for 3.16.

As far as how to consume it: send a branch with these patches on there, we'll
merge it in. If it's relatively conflict-free we'll do it under next/clenaup
for early merge, otherwise we'll save it for the end of our branches, etc. It'd
be a great cleanup to get merged so we'll make it work somehow!
