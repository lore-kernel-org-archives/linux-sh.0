Sorry, I do try to accumulate them but sometimes I miss some.

I will add Linus's Reviewed-by.
I will also check through all the patches in this pull-request
(renesas-pinmux2-for-v3.10).
for missing acks. And I will repost this pull-request.

I will also repost the renesas-boards3-for-v3.10 pull-request after
checking it for missing acks and rebasing it on the new
renesas-pinmux2-for-v3.10.
