ARM: shmobile: KZM9D legacy board code removal

[PATCH 01/04] ARM: shmobile: Add shared EMEV2 code for ->init_machine()
[PATCH 02/04] ARM: shmobile: Use ->init_late() in shared EMEV2 case
[PATCH 03/04] ARM: shmobile: Remove legacy KZM9D board code
[PATCH 04/04] ARM: shmobile: Remove legacy platform devices from EMEV2 SoC code 

With this patch set applied it is possible to use DT for KZM9D board support.
Because of this is the KZM9D legacy C board code removed together with EMEV2
platform devices. All these devices are available via DT anyway, so there is
no need to keep the C version. This saves some lines of code and shows where
mach-shmobile is heading in the future for all the SoCs.
