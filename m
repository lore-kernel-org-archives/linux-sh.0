I am not so sure about this.

First, I think there a too much software affecting these latencies to
call them hardware properties.

Second, I am not sure that the future version of genpd will have all
these four latencies, but maybe only two. Let's see. I would thus
suggest to put this patch on hold for a while.

Kind regards
