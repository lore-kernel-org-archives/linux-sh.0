The reason no GIC code is touched (for now), is that it's non-trivial to
fix the GIC driver to handle this.

Apart from being implemented using synchronous logic and thus using a
clock signal internally, the GIC and its driver don't care about this clock.

When an existing IP module that doesn't care about clocks becomes reused
on a new SoC, and it now ends up being part of a "PM Domain" (e.g. a Power
Domain or Clock Domain, or both), this "PM Domain" is a feature of the
platform, not of the IP module itself (cfr. "(Existing) Device Driver" in [1];
GIC falls in the same category as the Thermal Module example).
Hence I don't think it's necessary to mention this in the ARM GIC binding.

The proper way to handle this automatically is to add Runtime PM support
to the driver. However, this requires using a platform device.

I would like to add the clock and GIC dependency on the clock in the DTS now,
for reasons of DTS stability. But that means I need a temporary workaround
to avoid the clock from being disabled, until the GIC driver handles this.

I don't expect a fix for the GIC code to just show up magically. I just wanted
you to be aware of the problem. GIC is not the only problematic module here,
there are others, cfr. the last slide of [2].

Thanks!
