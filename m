Hi Ard,

I have observe what appears to be a build regression in next-20150323
caused by 06f75a1f62000 ("ARM, arm64: kvm: get rid of the bounce page").

# make
...
arm-unknown-linux-gnueabi-ld:./arch/arm/kernel/vmlinux.lds:546: syntax error

I have observed this using the cross-compiler that is available on kernel.org:
