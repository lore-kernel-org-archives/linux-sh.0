Hi Magnus,

Thanks for your comments.

Ok, I'll look into this, but I think that it will take some thinking.
The MERAM is accessed not only from the LCDC, but can also be accessed
from user space via the uio_pdrv_genirq driver.  I think we need to take
care of proper reference counting across these drivers.

I'm not sure that I follow your criteria for "low-performance
operation".  What do you define as low-performance?  Is this assuming
that we don't have (or disable) high-resolution (i.e. HDMI) secondary
output?
If so,it may be possible to dynamically reassign the area of the MERAM
that was allocated to HDMI for LCD output.  Otherwise the whole
framebuffer will not fit in MERAM and we'd have to revert to SDRAM.

By "keep an 8-bit RGB shadow buffer" are you talking about generating a
quantized version (RGB 332) of the "real" framebuffer in the MERAM when
we switch modes? It would be nice to be able to do such a conversion in
the hardware, but there currently isn't any support for VEU or the like
in the kernel.

Thanks again for your feedback,
