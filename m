Because the lager board only seems to expose SATA1 and I was
interested in something I could test.

I am happy to start caring about SATA0 if you think it is

Sure, but I'm unsure how you want r8a7790_register_sata to handle id.

Is it just for the id field of struct platform_device_info pdevinfo?
Or also to switch between resources somehow?

I chose register as it seemed to be consistent with the
existing contents of r8a7790_add_standard_devices().
