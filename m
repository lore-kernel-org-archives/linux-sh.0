Maybe not, I just misread your patch description as that it only should 
touch the board itself. Since intc-sh7377.c has to be touched too, this 
should be tested, I think. And I don't have any 7377 hardware available. 
Also, would anything break, if we split this into three patches? The first 
one would only modify g4evm.c with demuxed IRQs but without names. Then 
the sdhi/tmio driver will install the generic ISR for each of them, and in 
fact all interrupts would still only come on one IRQ. Then the second 
patch would modify intc-sh7377.c, after which IRQs will be routed to 
different vectors. And the third patch would then add names to IRQs. But 
maybe Paul prefers a single patch for all that.

Thanks
