Subject: [PATCH 00/10] pwm-backlight: Add GPIO and power supply support

This series adds the ability to specify a GPIO and a power supply to
enable a backlight.

Patch 1 refactors the power on and power off sequences into separate
functions in preparation for subsequent patches.

Patch 2 adds an optional GPIO to enable a backlight. This patch only
includes the field within the platform data so that it can be properly
setup before actually being put to use.

Patches 3 to 7 convert all users of the pwm-backlight driver to use the
new field. For most of them, this just initializes the field to -1,
marking the field as unused.

Patch 8 uses the new field within the pwm-backlight driver and at the
same time allows it to be parsed from device tree.

Patch 9 implements support for an optional power supply. This relies on
the regulator core to return a dummy regulator when no supply has been
otherwise setup so the driver doesn't have to handle that specially nor
require all users to be updated.

Patch 10 adds a way to keep a backlight turned off at boot. This is
useful when hooking up a backlight with a subsystem such as DRM which
has more explicit semantics as to when a backlight should be turned on.

Due to the dependencies within the series, I propose to take all these
patches through the PWM tree, so I'll need acks from OMAP, PXA, Samsung,
shmobile and Unicore32 maintainers.
