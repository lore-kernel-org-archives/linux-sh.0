Do you mean some of them only have a clockevent driver but no clocksource,
and use the jiffies clocksource instead?

I've looked at the three drivers/clocksource/{sh,em}_*.c files, and it seems
sh_mtu2.c indeed has no clocksource support, although the binding description
mentions that it has multiple counters that could be used for this
purpose. This timer is only used on R7S72100, so if you add
'register_current_timer_delay' calls to the other drivers, you can
decide to either keep computing the lpj value for R7S72100 but not the
others, or try to add a clocksource implementation to mtu2 as well.

Note that the read_current_timer() function for the delay implementation
doesn't have to be based on the same timer as the clocksource, but in
practice it often is.
