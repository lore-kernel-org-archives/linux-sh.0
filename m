This device has 10 sound channels, and using 3 kind of IPs.
Then, data input/output needs DMA channel which needs specific ID to using.
Above name has ID pair for it, so there is much combination. 
These specific ID is based on SoC, not board.
Sound driver / DMAEngine can get specific ID from above.

Indeed binding itself was not documented yet.
I will add it ASAP.
