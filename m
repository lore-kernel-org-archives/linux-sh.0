Based on the renesas-devel-20141211-v3.18 tag of my renesas tree

v2 [Simon Horman]
* As suggested by Kuninori Morimoto
  - Use clock-indicies instead of renesas,clock-indicies

v1 [Simon Horman]
* Removed portions of patch which add device node and alias
* Renamed patch from
  "ARM: shmobile: r8a7794: Add QSPI clock and device to device tree" to
  "ARM: shmobile: r8a7794: Add QSPI clock to device tree"
