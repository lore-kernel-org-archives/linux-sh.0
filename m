It's not that bad but, well, it requires changes elsewhere (U-Boot
already does this for some SoCs).

You should only drop the "if (dev_get_cma_area(NULL))" check.

We are kind of stretching this definition if the CMA check is removed.
The check could added back if DMA allocations are ever fixed to avoid
memory attributes aliases (right now they still exist, even though
temporarily). A situation where this bit probably does not need to be
set (though it's harmless) is I/O coherent systems ("arm,io-coherent").

My view is that we should always set this bit without any additional DT
properties but if it's easier to get it accepted this way, I'm fine as
well.

BTW, your patch mentions r2p0. My reading of the PL310 TRM shows this
bit as default from r0p0.
