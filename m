Well, looking at the output of

	git diff --dirstat=3D3 linus/master...next/master -- arch

(with linus/master =3D 85f2e689a and next/master =3D 9e06a6ea7) I think
the main culprit is 12dc7eff5 that moved arch/arm/mach-mx3 to
arch/arm/mach-imx. (75 files changed, 9783 insertions(+), 9731
deletions(-)) That's a part of the effort to consolidate the i.MX
platforms and allow to compile more SoCs in a single image.

That commit accounts for more than the half of the (loc) changes in
arch/arm.

OK, this doesn't discuss away the 6000 added lines, but at least the
percentage thingy. And I think when you point out this commit Linus will
be much quiter when replying to your pull request.

Best regards
Uwe
