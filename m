Thanks for giving more details. You write that you are unsure about
some things, would it be possible for you to track down those things
so we know for sure?

The sleep mode you are using is a plan "WFI" at this point, right? If
you are controlling power domains then you may have to involve the
SYSC hardware depending on which power domains you turn off.

Is it possible that the IRQ of the st1232 is in level trigger mode,
and when you use the touch screen the IRQ gets asserted and remains
asserted? If you read out the registers of the st1232 can you see if
the IRQ is asserted?

Another alternative is that the INTC code is masking with priority
instead of bitmap and something is lacking. It sounds more like an
asserted interrupt though.

Yet another option is that some piece of code is missing to
acknowledge interrupts on resume.

That's exciting. =)

For other people to help you it would be good if you could share more
information, like for instance which git branch you are working
against and also if you have done any modifications yourself.

I suppose you will have to decode how the different IRQs are mapped in
intc-sh73a0.c.

One of the key differences between r8a7740 and sh73a0 is that r8a7740
is using INTC only and sh73a0 is making use of the GIC. So for KZM9G
you have to take the GIC into consideration. If you have not dived
into that code yet then now is a good time.

Also, regarding the external IRQ pins on sh73a0, perhaps the function
sh73a0_set_wake() needs to be updated?

Why don't you focus on tracking down the r8a7740 external IRQ issue?
Try to figure out if the IRQ is stuck asserted.

As for sh73a0 External IRQ pins, I am about to post a v2 of my INTC
external IRQ pin driver and will also include some platform data for
sh73a0. You may want to give that a try.

A good conclusion here is probably that this patch adding the
IRQF_NO_SUSPEND flag is not the correct solution to these problems.
You may have to do some modification about the drivers, but I believe
they are likely to be rather fine as-is. In the case of the st1232
driver it has been used on the sh7372 mackerel board and there we are
(at least have been) able to use Suspend-to-RAM in various ways.
