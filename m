That device also has other clocks, so, previously, with the device pointer 
but with an unmatching device string I was getting a wrong clock - the one 
from the device... So, it is a step in the "right" direction in the sense, 
that I am now getting a correct clock. But yes, if I can associate one 
clock with several devices, that's even better! I'll try that.
