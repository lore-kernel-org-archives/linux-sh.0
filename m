Ok, now that we sorted the misunderstanding out, let's start this topic
from here again. (I really read your reply as: "let's move the CPUS
somewhere else")


What's the list of stuff you discovered using sysdevs, which is not a
device at all, and has never more than a single instance of stuff of the
same type? The clocksource?

And let's find some place for them to put their properties instead of
messing around with device from the driver core.
