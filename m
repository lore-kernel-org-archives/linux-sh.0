Hmm.  For now, my patchset generally reorganizes the existing code without
adding new functionality.  Of course, it is possible to add new functionality
on top of it, but I'd prefer to focus on the "real" power domains support
first (which I think should be done in a generic way too).

The plan is to share as much code as it makes sense between platforms and
architectures.

Thanks,
Rafael
