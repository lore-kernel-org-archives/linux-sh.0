I think it works just fine without them.

Should I drop all cache-* properties marked optional in
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/arm/l2cc.txt?
That would be cache-size, cache-sets, cache-block-size, and cache-line-size.

What about the L1 cache? I know Linux uses none of the d-cache-*
and i-cache-* properties.

Thanks!
