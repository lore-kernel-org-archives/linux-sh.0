You are right that ioremap cannot be used from ->smp_init_cpus() and any
code called from there needs to use a static mapping for accessing
MMIO registers. There is nothing wrong with that. There are in fact
three distinct reasons why people use static MMIO mappings with
iotable_init():

1. For MMIO registers that need to be accessed before ioremap works.
   This usually means the SMP startup and the early printk (which I
   believe shmobile is not using).

2. For getting hugetlb mappings of MMIO registers into the kernel
   address space. If you have a lot of registers in the same area,
   using a single TLB to map them is more efficient, even when 
   accessing the registers through ioremap from a device driver.

3. For hardcoding the virtual address to a location that is passed
   to device drivers as compile-time constants.

The first two are absolutely fine, there are no objections to those.
The third one is tradtitionally used on a lot of the older platforms,
but with the multiplatform work, we are moving away from it, towards
passing resources in the platform device (ideally from DT, but that
is an orthogonal question here). AFAICT, shmobile is the only "modern"
platform that still relies on fixed virtual addresses, and it is the
only one I know that uses a mapping where the virtual address equals
the physical address.
