Just for explanation:
EM/EV2(there is "/" according to its Users Manual) might be a little difficult
 one for general discussion. It stands for "EMMA Mobile EV2", and is a SoC of
"EMMA Mobile" series, they say. So, possibly, the string was
 emmamobile-smu or emmamobile-smu-ev2 if it is EV2 specific variant.

But, EMEV2 is the only SoC known in EMMA Mobile series, and no document found
 to tell if some other one(if any. there used to be, they say) has SMU or not. 
That's why I choose "emev2-smu". This is <unit> part, and no <soc> portion.

These clock node is defined not as memory-mapped.

Looks strange? I think so.
This _was introduced_ to comply ePAPR that requires the node name to consist
of generic name and @address to make it unique.
So, the first version was like this.
| usia_u0_sclkdiv: clock@610,0 {
| 	compatible = "renesas,emev2-smu-clkdiv";
| 	reg = <0x610 0>;

But later, I trashed it for the consistency with clock nodes without <reg>, say

I am still not sure what the clock nodes should be. But, I think what we are
 discussing is out of the scope of current ePAPR, which does not give the answer.

Oops. Thank you.
