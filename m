The IPMMU driver doesn't need to know the number of micro-TLBs, so we should 
be fine without specifying it in DT. The micro-TLBs are configured when a bus 
master device is attached or detached, and at that point the device provides 
its micro-TLB number.

The only reason I can foresee why the number of micro-TLBs would be useful is 
to iterate over micro-TLBs when the driver probes the device to disable them 
all. A mask would probably be better than a number in that case, and I think 
we can always add that later if we find a need for it.
