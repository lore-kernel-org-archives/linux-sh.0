Hi Shimoda-san

Thanks for an update. Sorry it took me so long to get down to reviewing 
it. I looked at it originally and I knew, I would need a significant time 
this time to look and think about it, so, I had to postpone. This looks 
much better already, thanks! The flow is already correct, but I think it 
might be possible to improve it further. Please, see below.

I don't think we'll need this eventually.

Ok, this is an entry point, you have to act here, agree. But how about the 
following: we add a new WAIT state: MMCIF_WAIT_FOR_SBC and use that one 
inside sh_mmcif_start_cmd() instead of MMCIF_WAIT_FOR_CMD in the SBC case? 
Then maybe you won't need to change sh_mmcif_request() at all or almost at 
all:

this call might change, see later.

This will set "host->wait_for = MMCIF_WAIT_FOR_CMD"

Now, when we enter sh_mmcif_irqt() after an SBC command completion, we 
still have "host->wait_for = MMCIF_WAIT_FOR_CMD" so we enter 
sh_mmcif_end_cmd(), right? But you set mrq->data = NULL above, so, it just 
(possibly) gets a response and returns. So far so good.

With the proposed MMCIF_WAIT_FOR_SBC you'll have something like

	case MMCIF_WAIT_FOR_SBC:
		wait = sh_mmcif_end_sbc(host);
		break;

In sh_mmcif_end_sbc() you would do a similar to sh_mmcif_end_cmd() error 
processing, maybe get a response (no idea, whether SBC has MMC_RSP_PRESENT 
set), call sh_mmcif_start_cmd() again, but there now you have to take care 
not to jump to the same state again, but to use MMCIF_WAIT_FOR_CMD this 
time. So, your wait-assignment in sh_mmcif_start_cmd() would look like

	if (mrq->sbc && host->wait_for != MMCIF_WAIT_FOR_SBC)
		host->wait_for = MMCIF_WAIT_FOR_SBC;
	else
		host->wait_for = MMCIF_WAIT_FOR_CMD;

and return true.

Hm, this is interesting. Why do you need those? Currently we only wait for 
read- and write-end conditions in single-block read- and write-operations, 
but not in multi-block ones. With SBC you also want to wait for them in 
the multi-block case. Is it really SBC-specific or maybe we have to do 
this always? In either case I wouldn't add it here but to respective 
state-handlers, called from the switch statement above. And if this is 
indeed needed for all multi-block operations, this should be a separate 
patch.

Currently you enter this path also after processing an SBC, which isn't 
needed, but just happens to be harmless. If you use MMCIF_WAIT_FOR_SBC you 
don't get here at all.

This won't be needed.
