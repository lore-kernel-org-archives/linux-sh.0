QEMU is an emulator. I've run sh4 linux on it for about 10 years now.
Sounds like they never implemented this feature because nothing used it
before now.

My general approach when dealing with this sort of thing is to point
figures at the thing that changed, and caused "it was working" to go to
"it's not working". When qemu broke this same sh4 serial port, I asked
_them_ to fix it:

https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2012-07/msg03929.html

Asking qemu to change means current kernels will never run on existing
qemu installations again, when they did for a decade now, which seems
like a regression to me?
