I had grouped the renesas-soc-cleanup-for-v4.1 into next/multiplatform
rather than next/cleanup, and would like to keep the two separate
unless there is a good reason not to.

If you haven't already based other work on top of renesas-soc-cleanup2-for-v4.1
and there are no other conflicts, could you rebase it to -rc1?
