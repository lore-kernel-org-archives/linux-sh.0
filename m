Shouldn't that mask be 30 instead of 31 when you only support DMA
to the first GB?

Another possibility is that 'EARLY' means it gets applied before
the normal mask is set.

Finally, setting the mask itself is not enough. As I mentioned you
also need to use the swiotlb_dma_ops. Did you already implement
those?
