Just looking at the em_sti driver. It calls clk_prepare/unprepare from
interrupt disabled regions ...

But that's not the problem at hand I think. The above commit is moving
the call to the event handler on the local cpu out of the broadcast
lock region to prevent a live lock. The only real change is the
timing.

Before:

	bc_handler()
	  lock(bc_lock);
	  call_local_handler();
	  send_ipis();
	  reprogramm_bc_device();
	  unlock(bc_lock);

After:

	bc_handler()
	  lock(bc_lock);
	  send_ipis();
	  reprogramm_bc_device();
	  unlock(bc_lock);
	  call_local_handler();

As this runs in hard interrupt context with interrupts disabled, I
really cannot figure out how that makes a difference.

Can you add some debugging to figure out whether the broadcast timer
interrupt still fires?

Thanks,
