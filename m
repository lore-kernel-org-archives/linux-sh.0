        Hi Simon, Magnus,

This patch series integrates support for the MSIOF module in the Renesas
R-Car H2 (r8a7790) and M2 (r8a7791) SoCs on the Lager and Koelsch
development boards.

It was tested on Lager and Koelsch, both legacy and DT, using a dummy
driver for the Renesas r2a11302ft PMIC that reads out the PMIC's version
ID.
