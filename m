If you look at of_irq_map_raw, there are cases that look at
#address-cells. Those appear to be only when you have an interrupt-map
though.

The docs probably should state #addr-cells is only required with
interrupt-map.

Some boards are using interrupt-map, so they may need #address-cells. So
I'm inclined to leave things alone.
