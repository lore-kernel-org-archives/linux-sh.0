I'm the one who added the SuperH bits a few years ago. Judging by the
text above it seems like you prefer not to build this driver for MIPS.
Which is totally fine with me.

As for SH and SH-Mobile ARM, unless explicitly requested we usually
don't restrict our platform drivers. Allowing them to build on any
system helps to catch compile errors. It also makes it possible to add
board support by simply adding platform data to the board file and
then updating the kconfig. Keeping the amount of code at the bare
minimum makes back porting rather easy too.

I'm not sure if the ax88796 driver does something non-standard to
require special symbols, but usually platform drivers are rather clean
and can be compiled for any architecture or platform. At least in
theory. =3D)

Cheers,
