    I'm going to post R8A7778/BOCK-W series following this one, and all the 
patches in 1st series should additionally be tested on BOCK-W. Well, I 
probably can hold up posting version 3 until I have the second series verified.
    BTW, about R8A7778/BOCK-W, R-Car M1A user manual talks about a ferrite 
bead in 49.4.1 (3) Setting USB-PHY. Do you know for sure if it's used or not
on BOCK-W board? PHY initialization seems to work with either settings...
