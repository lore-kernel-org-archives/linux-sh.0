I vaguely recall this coming up before, and it wasn't acceptable then
either.

We will by no means be adding driver-specific hooks in to other drivers
that really couldn't care less what the underlying DMA engine driving
them is.

We already have CPUs with different DMA engines that can be used by the
same drivers. As I said the last time, this needs to be fixed in the
dmaengine framework, period.
