Hi Morimoto-san,

Sorry for the late reply.

No, that's not what I meant. The CPG should certainly not care about any MMCIF 
internal divider.

My point was about the name of the structure. However, now that you mention 
the internal MMCIF clock divider, the word "parent" indeed makes sense. Please 
ignore my comment.

Once again it really depends where the constraints come from. If the MMC input 
clock frequency range constraint is dictated by the MMCIF IP core only, 
options 2 and 3 are equivalent and just differ by whether they specify the 
range explicitly in DT (option 2) or implicitly through the compatible name 
(option 3).

If the range constraint comes from the CPG, option 1 is the way to go, 
(although the admissible divider range could also be speficied in the MMC 
driver as in option 3).

If the range constraint is a property of the integration of the MMCIF in the 
SoC then I think option 2 is the best. The per-SoC compatible strings can be 
used to express differences between IP core versions found in different SoCs, 
but they shouldn't be used to express integration properties.

To clarify this with an example, it's fine for the DU driver to use the per-
SoC compatible string to know how many display channels the DU contains, but 
it can't be used to hardcode IRQ numbers in the driver, even if we know which 
IRQ the DU is hooked to for each SoC. The former is a property of the DU 
version, the latter is a property of the integration and should be expressed 
in DT.
