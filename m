Ok, this gets rid of the warning, but I'm a bit worried about
how it is hardwiring the fact that the SCU physical address has
the same bit pattern as the __iomem token.

While I realize that you already rely on this in a lot of places
in the shmobile code, I see a red light going off every time I read
code like this, and it is not any more logical than the previous
version.

It would be nice to keep these address spaces separate at least
in new code, mostly in order to not confuse reviewers with code
that is based on assumptions which are not generally true, but also
to be more flexible with the virtual memory layout. On a related
topic, you are using an entire 256 MB section of your virtual
address space for sh73a0 and sh7372 and 160 MB for r8a7740. Putting
less of that into the identity mapped area would free up space for
vmalloc, but it's hard to prove that doing this is correct when
you have all sorts of code using a hardcoded virtual MMIO address
token.
