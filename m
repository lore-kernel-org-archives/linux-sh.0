OLPC's using DDR50 at 3.3V in production.  Honestly, I don't know
whether it's spec compliant (I think the spec claims that 1.8V is
required) but it happens to work on these parts.  The host controller
does support 1.8V, there's just no hardware capable of supplying 1.8V
to MMC on the board.

Thanks,
