Largely due to DT unification, some parts of the code became obsolete. Let's
remove that, the code is complex enough still:

* There are no boards anymore with named interrupt support. Drop support for
  that (patches 2-4)
* No need anymore for a public mmc/tmio.h header file. Merge it into the
  private one (patch 5)

Patches 1+6 are small cleanups found on the way :)

Based on latest renesas-drivers which is based on v4.6-rc1 with my sdr50
patches on top. Tested on a Renesas Lager board and build bot is happy, too
(after finding some issues initially). A branch for testing is here:

git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/wsa/linux.git renesas/sdhi-uhs

I'd think this should all go via mmc, so an ACK from a sh-maintainer on patch 2
would be much appreciated.

Please test, comment, apply...
