Dimitry,

you seem to have signed-off on most of the st1232 I see in the git history.
Could you take this patch?

There is an accompanying patch for the Armaillo800EVA which depends on this
change, so it would be good if you could take that too.

Alternatively I can take both patches through my renesas tree if
that is better for you.
