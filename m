Note: Adding clocks whilst keeping the current sorting is very likely to
break a previously working clock IMO. Imagine adding PCIEC clock inbetween IIC0
and IIC1 here. Adding chronologically and grouped by similar function blocks is
easier to track. An example addition could then look like:

 	R8A7790_CLK_TPU0
 	R8A7790_CLK_SDHI3 R8A7790_CLK_SDHI2 R8A7790_CLK_SDHI1 R8A7790_CLK_SDHI0
 	R8A7790_CLK_MMCIF1 R8A7790_CLK_MMCIF0
 	R8A7790_CLK_CMT1
	R8A7790_CLK_IIC2 R8A7790_CLK_IIC1 R8A7790_CLK_IIC0
+	R8A7790_CLK_PCIEC
