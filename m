Hmmm, as I don't seem to be able to persude someone else to do the hard
work, I did it.  Here are the hard facts:

	- clkdev_alloc is exported
	- clkdev is called by clk_add_alias
	- clk_add_alias is exported
	- clkdev_alloc is called by impd1_probe
	  (arch/arm/mach-integrator/impd1.c)
	  Can be compiled as a module.
	- clk_add_alias is called from __init functions only in
		arch/arm/mach-davinci/dm355.c
		arch/arm/mach-davinci/dm365.c
		arch/arm/mach-davinci/dm644x.c
		arch/arm/mach-pxa/eseries.c
		arch/arm/mach-pxa/lubbock.c
		arch/arm/mach-pxa/tosa.c
		arch/sh/kernel/cpu/clock-cpg.c
	  All these cannot be compiled as a module.
	- clk_add_alias is called from non-__init functions that could
	  be __init:
		arch/arm/mach-omap1/board-nokia770.c
	  This cannot be compiled as a module.

So the actions needed before make clkdev_alloc and clk_add_alias __init are:

	- register the clocks for impd1 in machine code, not the driver
	- move hwa742_dev_init to .init.text
	- don't export clkdev_alloc and clk_add_alias

I guess the first is simple, the rest trivial, no?

Best regards
Uwe
