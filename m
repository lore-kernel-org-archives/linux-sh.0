Ok, but I still think this isn't right. See below.

I don't see this as being a "looks good" problem; I see this as being
"what's the right way to teardown a uart device that's going away when
a tty console is running on it", and there are too many problems with
uart_remove_one_port() doing:

      state->uart_port = NULL

to keep with that solution.

And this is the central problem: uart_close() must complete normally
if a tty console is still running on a device.

For example, if uart_shutdown() isn't getting called, then who's freeing
the ring buffer page?

See my comments to the v2 patch there.
