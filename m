Other SuperH Mobile multimedia blocks like the CEU and VEU/VPU/JPU all
get passed a physically contiguous area of memory as platform data. So
for those blocks the memory range show up in /proc/iomem. For the LCDC
this does not happen today.

Thanks for pointing out the module issue. I guess the proper fix would
be to pass a struct resource with memory to the LCDC driver as well
instead of this patch.

Cheeers,
