Hi Mike,

for some reason I thought you had taken this change but I now
realise that is not the case. I apologise for not being more attentive.

I am wondering if you could consider taking it as I have some SoC-side
changes that depend on it which I would like to queue up for v3.14.
Actually, I have them queued up and was preparing some branches based on
v3.13-rc1 for the ARM-SoC maintainers when I noticed this patch
had not been accepted.

I think that any of the following would work well for me:
I'm sure there are also other options.

1. You could take this into a branch which won't subsequently
   be rebased and I can use that as a base for a branch
   for the SoC-side changes which I intend to have merged into
   the ARM-SoC tree.

2. You could take this for v3.13. But it is probably far to late for that.

3. I could take this change with the SoC-side changes which I
   intend to have merged into the ARM-SoC tree.

Another option is for me to drop the SoC-side changes for now.
But that is not my preferred option.
