You really need to read the entire thread - I've already said that yet
discussion continues about how to solve the problem.  This thread which
has been running for a number of days now has been entirely about how
to solve this.

No one can agree on what the one sane implementation should be.

Consider this: is it better to continue talking about this for the next
six months, while still having N spinlock based implementations, and M
mutex based implementations.

Or is it better to consolidate the N spinlock based implementations
down to one spinlock implementation, and M mutex based implementations
down to one mutex implementation, and then discuss how to resolve the
differences between the two implementations?

I personally don't care whether we stick with the ever growing number of
clk API implementations, whether we continue discussing it for the next
six months, or whether we consolidate what we can.  I suspect there are
people who do care greatly, so I'm trying to suggest a way we can see
_some_ kind of progress on this consolidation effort.
