Sorry for the delay, it has taken me a while to secure a JTAG.

I now have one hooked up to my emev2/kzm9d board; though I must
confess I am not at all experienced in driving it.

As far as I can tell, and to be quite honest I would not be at all
surprised if I am mistaken, the CPUs are sitting here:

pc: 0xC001F7E8, which corresponds to cpu_v7_do_idle

Hooking up GDB I see:

#0  cpu_v7_do_idle () at arch/arm/mm/proc-v7.S:74
#1  0xc0010734 in arch_cpu_idle () at arch/arm/kernel/process.c:72
#2  0xc04c406c in schedule_preempt_disabled () at kernel/sched/core.c:3115
#3  0xc0055130 in cpu_idle_loop () at kernel/sched/idle.c:279
#4  cpu_startup_entry (state=CPUHP_OFFLINE) at kernel/sched/idle.c:301
#5  0xc04bf440 in rest_init () at init/main.c:412
#6  0xc061bc6c in start_kernel () at init/main.c:683
#7  0x4000807c in ?? ()


I am using the renesas-devel-20150729-v4.2-rc4 tag of the my renesas tree
which, as the name suggests, is based on v4.2-rc4.
