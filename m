Iwamatsu-san wrote this binding based on our C version of the INTC
tables. And I wrote the original INTC table code based on perhaps 30+
data sheet. They code was initially designed to allow people to input
data straight off the data sheet - this so we could support a wide
range of slightly different interrupt controllers.

Feel free to review the code, but I am not sure why anyone would case
about this Renesas specific legacy interrupt controller. If I were to
chose how cycles should be spent then I think it is better to try to
come up with power domain DT bindings for all SoC vendors.

Also, there are the DT board code queued up that makes use of this controller.

Thanks,
