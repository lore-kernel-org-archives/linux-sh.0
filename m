    I have now implemented PHY IRQ support for BOCK-W, Lager, and Koelsch 
boards (had to extend the Micrel PHY driver to recognize undocumented 
KSZ8041RNLI PHY ID for that) but I must say that the PHY interrupt doesn't get 
generated on either of the board and I don't know why yet (I can't rule out 
the INTC driver issue); that's bad news. Good news is that even this doesn't 
prevent phylib from working properly as it still polls the PHY once a second.
