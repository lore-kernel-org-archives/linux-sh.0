Your patch is also continuing the pattern with this code...

If you look carefully at this, you'll notice that it's utter crap.
(Sorry, but it is.)  It has two problems:

1. It'll never match a Cortex-A9 CPU.  Cortex-A9 has a MIDR value of
   0x412fc09a, not 0x00000c09.  The bit position of the part number
   field isn't even right.

2. If it does match, then we branch to "v7_invalidate_l1" without setting
   the link register: we'll never return back here (we'll return to whatever
   random value the link register contains) and so we'll never make it to
   secondary_startup.  *Thankfully*, because of (1), this branch will
   never be taken - this is it's saving grace.

Your patch introduces a /third/ form of crapiness:

3. If the PSR happens to have Z=1, the "beq" instruction will be taken,
   thereby crashing the system because of (2).

The /simplest/ change which would fix this problem is to just change
proc-v7.S.  The remainder is effectively a cleanup removing redundant
code.
