I have two different versions of powering down the SoC. Currently I'm
focusing on a shutdown mode that contains the powering off of the L2.

The problem I see with this approach is:
What advantage do we get at all if we have to flush the L2 (which is
done in the PL310 disable routine)? Isn't this exactly the part we
want to save? Not to have to flush the L2.

Ah true! When I enter my assembly code there are of course stack modifications.
And here comes a point I've just realized recently: Sometimes the WFI
command doesn't enter the low power state mode I've requested. I
haven't observed this when using Suspend-To-Ram but when using
CPUIdle.
I've seen code from the OMAP people that check for the case that WFI
doesn't succeed. Probably I need to do the same. And for this I need
the stack to be synced.

Ok great, I'm quite blown away by the support here, should have
contacted you earlier!
