I've tested this patch series on a multicore Cortex-A9 board. If I
revert patch 5/6 (ARM: Make oprofile depend on CONFIG_HW_PERF_EVENTS)
then everything seems to work fine. Otherwise, testing without
HW_PERF_EVENTS doesn't fall back to timer mode.

So, with the exception of the patch above:

Tested-by: Will Deacon <will.deacon@arm.com>

Cheers!
