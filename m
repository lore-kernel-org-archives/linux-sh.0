No, not for this driver.

But there are several drivers (spi-rspi, spi-sh-msiof, sh-sci, sh_flctl) that
have .slave*id* fields in platform data, but no platform code ever sets them.
Despite platform code that fills in SHDMA_SLAVE_* values in sh_dmae_chan.
These don't work anyway, and I don't think anyone is interested in fixing that.
