But given the timing I think I'll just start to revert things and we can add
them back later after we've sorted out all problems.

So I'm going to drop commit dceff5c from the linux-next branch and I'm going to
revert commit 7c30ed5 along with commit 266c13d that tried to fix it and we'll
revisit the transition serialization issue when we really know how to fix it.

Thanks,
Rafael
