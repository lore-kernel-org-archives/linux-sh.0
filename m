Basically we need to change the driver platform data, so the first part gets 
the driver in shape by adding new platform data fields, the second part 
switches the platform code, and the third part removes the old fields. Part of 
this is about switching from passing IRQs and memory base through platform 
data to passing them through resources, which is a dependency for OF support.
