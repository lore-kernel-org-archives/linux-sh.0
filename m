	Hi all,

This patch series migrates the shmobile DT-based generic r8a7740 and
armadillo legacy platforms from calling l2x0_of_init() to the generic
l2c OF initialization.

It was sent before as "[PATCH v2 0/5] ARM: shmobile: r8a7740/armadillo:
Migrate to generic l2c OF". Major changes in v3 are the introduction of
the "arm,shared-override" property in DT, and only setting the Shared
Override bit if CMA is not available. Note that not setting this bit may
lead to memory corruption in the presence of other bus masters.

For shmobile, this conversion should be done on sh73a0, r8a7778, and
r8a7779, too.

Several other ARM platforms (berlin, cns3xxx, nomadik, omap, realview,
sti, tegra, vexpress) currently set the Shared Override bit in various
ways. As soon as the first patch in this series is accepted, they can
start specifying the "arm,shared-override" property in their DTSes, and
remove the corresponding board code.

Changes in v3:
  - Add DT support for Shared Override,
  - Setting Shared Override is done only if CMA is not available (as
    Russell claims it's not needed if CMA is available),
  - Use 0/~0 in machine_desc.l2c_aux_{val,mask}, as DT now supports
    "arm,shared-override".

Changes in v2:
  - Fix interrupt reference in DT,
  - Describe L2 better in DT,
  - Keep only {,~}L2C_AUX_CTRL_SHARED_OVERRIDE in
    machine_desc.l2c_aux_{val,mask}, as there's no DT property for
    this.
  - Add L1 cache to DT.

Dependencies:
  - Although there are separate patches for ARM code, dtsi, SoC code, and
    board code, there are dependencies among the individual patches:
      - patches 3 and 4 depend on patches 1 and 2,
      - patch 5 depends on patches 3 and 4,
      - patch 6 depends on patch 2.

This was tested on armadillo-legacy and armadillo-multiplatform.

Thanks!
