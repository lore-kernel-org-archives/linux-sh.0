This is introducing a new DT binding which needs to be documented. Also
you need to cc devicetree mailing list in case you need to add new
bindings. But I think you should not require this new binding.

I couldn't understand this patch completely but I believe you are
trying to solve multi-cluster power management and in your own custom
way.

But there are 2 ways to handle this in a generic way:
1. If Linux runs in non-secure mode, you need to use PSCI.
   You can refer Calxeda platform for reference[1]
2. If Linux runs in secure mode, you need to use MPCM
   You can refer Vexpress CA15_CA7/TC2 platform for reference[2]

This sequences exactly matches the power-down sequence for CA15/A7.
(implemented in [2]). Unless your platform needs a different sequence,
you can re-use the code. Nico was trying to consolidate the power-down
sequence for all ARM Cortex-A15/A7 implementations[3].
