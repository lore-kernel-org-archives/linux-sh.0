Hi,

Sorry for the late respones.

That's OK, but that doesn't solve the issue the $subject patch tries to
address.

You still seem to be confusing preventing the clock from being disabled
at all (which may be necessary for some command sequences etc.) with preventing
the host adapter from being put into an overly deep low-power state _after_
_the_ _clock_ _has_ _been_ _disabled_.  They are two _different_ issues
and there's no way we can address them both by using timeouts.

With PM domains support on SH7372 we can easily have a situation in which
the controller's runtime PM causes a whole domain to go off (or in a more
complicated scenario, the runtime PM of some _other_ device in the same PM
domain causes it to go off while the MMC controller is in the "suspended"
state) and that leads to an overly long delay in the MMC subsystem.  So,
we need to address this issue _in_ _addition_ to ensuring that the controller
is _not_ suspended when it shouldn't be.

Thanks,
Rafael
