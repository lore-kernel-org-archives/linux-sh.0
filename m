Hi everybody,

When trying to understand the sh_mobile_lcdc driver, I found it hard to read
statements that include hardcoded register values. I thus wrote a patch that
replace them with macros, making the code more readable.

While doing so, I found two potential issues in the driver. See patches 2 and
3 for detailed explanations and fixes.

Laurent Pinchart (3):
  fbdev: sh_mobile_lcdc: Replace hardcoded register values with macros
  fbdev: sh_mobile_lcdc: Don't acknowlege interrupts unintentionally
  fbdev: sh_mobile_lcdc: Compute clock pattern using divider
    denominator
