The reason DMABOUNCE should be avoided is because it is a known source
of OOMs, and that has never been investigated and fixed.  You can read
about some of the kinds of problems this code creates here:

That was never got to the bottom of.  I could harp on about not having
the hardware, the people with the hardware not being capable of debugging
it, or not willing to litter their kernels with printks when they've
found a reproducable way to trigger it, etc - but none of that really
matters.

What matters is the end result is nothing was ever done to investigate
the causes, so it remains "unsafe" to use.

Can we please kill the idea that CONFIG_VMSPLIT_* has something to do
with DMA?  It doesn't.  VMSPLIT sets where the boundary between userspace
and kernel space is placed in virtual memory.  It doesn't really change
which memory is DMA-able.

There is the BLK_BOUNCE_HIGH option, but that's more to do with drivers
saying "I don't handle highmem pages because I'm old and no one's updated
me".

The same is true of highmem vs bouncing for DMA.  Highmem is purely a
virtual memory concept and has /nothing/ to do with whether the memory
can be DMA'd to.

Let's take an extreme example.  Let's say I set a 3G VM split, so kernel
memory starts at 0xc0000000.  I then set the vmalloc space to be 1024M -
but the kernel strinks that down to the maximum that can be accomodated,
which leaves something like 16MB of lowmem.  Let's say I have 512MB of
RAM in the machine.

Now let's consider I do the same thing, but with a 2G VM split.  Has the
memory pages which can be DMA'd to changed at all?  Yes, the CPU's view
of pages has changed, but the DMA engine's view hasn't changed /one/ /bit/.

Now consider when vmalloc space isn't expanded to maximum and all that
RAM is mapped into the kernel direct mapped region.  Again, any
difference as far as the DMA engine goes?  No there isn't.

So, the idea that highmem or vmsplit has any kind of impact on whether
memory can be DMA'd to by the hardware is absolutely absurd.

VMsplit and highmem are a CPU visible concept, and has very little to do
with whether the memory is DMA-able.
