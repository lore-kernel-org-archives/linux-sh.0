OK. What if I sumply remove arch_cpu_idle_prepare() and let you do the 
remove the rest?

IMHO I'd simply remove local_fiq_{enable/disable}() from 
arm64/kernel/smp.c and leave the infrastructure in place in case someone 
needs it eventually.  In which case I could include that into my patch 
as well.
