If you can get a build regression due to an outdated defconfig, then you're
likely missing some dependencies in your Kconfig? You could hit the same state
of configurations through randconfig. So I think fixing the dependencies is
better than relying on the defconfig branch in this case.

Would you mind doing it that way instead? It'd reduce our dependencies and in
general it's a more appropriate approach.

So what happens if someone has an old defconfig in their build environment
(i.e. hosted outside of the kernel tree), will they see breakage? If so, you
should probably add a new option ARCH_SHMOBILE_MULTI or similar.

We had similar issues with the first attempt to go multiplatform on Exynos,
some existing defconfigs wouldn't build a usable kernel any more due to new
options, so Arnd had to do it the other way (that code is still unmerged
though).
