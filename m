you mean

ALIGN_UP(x, PAGES_PER_SECTION) - x

but ...

1. There is no ALIGN_UP. "SECTION_ALIGN_UP(x) - x" would be possible
2. It would be wrong if x is already aligned.

e.g., let's use 4096 for simplicity as we all know that value by heart
(for both x and the block size).

a) -(4096 | -4096) -> 4096

b) #define ALIGN_UP(x, a) ((x + a - 1) & -(a))

ALIGN_UP(4096, 4096) - 4096 -> 0

Not as easy as it seems ...
