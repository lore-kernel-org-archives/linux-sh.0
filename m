If this model works for you, then I'm also fine with it. The only complaint
is that we now have a needless difference between the ARM SMMU driver and
your driver in the way that the device <-> smmu topology is described. I'd
be happy to try and move my driver over to your binding, but that would
break all existing users and, whilst there aren't any in-tree .dts files
using the ARM SMMU, I doubt it would be a popular move.

Isn't the master -> page table association a dynamic property, defined by
the (runtime) configuration of IOMMU domains? That is, you have one page
table per domain and the act of attaching a device to a domain associates
it with that page table? Or do you need an identity-mapped page table in
order to pass-through transactions when no translation is configured?
