Subject: [PATCH 0/6] UHS-I support for sh_mobile_sdhi

This series adds support for UHS-I in sh_mobile_sdhi, partly implemented
in tmio_mmc.  This does not yet include tuning for SDR-104, but SDR-50 now
works on the R8A7790 Lager board and another development board.

The pfc block needs to be reconfigured from 3.3V to 1.8V signalling on
the pins wired to the SD card.  This is supported by adding separate
functions for 1.8V signalling in sh-pfc ("sdhi0_1v8" etc.).  I expect
that several SH SoCs have this capability, but I only have the R8A7790
data sheet so I only implemented it for that one.

Changes since the RFC:
- Replace the 'regulator' devices for signal voltage switching with
  pinctrl functions and states
- Drop 'mmc: sh_mobile_sdhi: Add actual clock rate support' as it's
  redundant
- Use a switch statement in sh_mobile_sdhi_start_signal_voltage_switch()
- Fix subject prefix for the DT changes
