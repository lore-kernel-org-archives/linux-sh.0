I think it's mostly traditional reason I think.

AFAIK, on Cortex-A15 we already rely on getting the number of cores from
the device tree, which is also available at the right time, without
the need for an early mapping. It would not be hard to do the same
on Cortex-A9. Then again, the static mapping there does not do harm
as I said.

Ok.

I would certainly welcome a patch that moves the SMP initialization
to a later point. I'm not sure if it requires changes to architecture
independent code, but it does sound like a good idea.

Well, I would argue that when someone doesn't understand the basic
interfaces we expose to device drivers, they probably shouldn't
be writing kernel code. ;)

It may not be as bad as I thought. I know that at least the intc
controller is fundamentally built around this assumption (I tried changing
it, and that didn't end well), but that may be the only one, following
the recent cleanup of the pfc driver.

The main worry is probably that people will take the platform code
as example when writing device drivers, and that uses hardcoded
IOMEM() macros.  There are probably a couple of instances where that
is the best solution, but for those, I would suggest using offsets
from a base register that gets passed into iotable_init() rather
than literal numbers.

Ok, good to hear.
