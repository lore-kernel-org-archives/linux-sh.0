Precisely because the HW /is/ compatible.

If the HW interface (registers) in two chips A and B is such that a
driver for chip A can be expected to run unmodified on chip B too
(albeit perhaps without yet supporting any new features, or perhaps not
running at full performance etc.), then chip B /is/ compatible with chip
A, and it makes sense to mark it so in DT. That way, an old kernel which
had support for chip A can run on chip B. A newer kernel might come
along later with explicit support for chip B, and hence run faster
and/or expose new features, but the driver for chip A can still work on
chip B.

I don't consider that a mess, no. It's nice evolutionary HW design:-)
