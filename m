This is probably a matter of taste. I would argue that altmap doesn't
really equal ZONE_DEVICE. This is more a mechanism to use an alternative
memmap allocator. Sure ZONE_DEVICE is the only in tree user of the
feature but I really do not see why the arh specific code should care
about it. The lack of altmap allocator is handled in the sparse code so
this is just adding an early check which might confuse people in future.

Then block it on the config dependences.
