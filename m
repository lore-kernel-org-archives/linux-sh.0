I am surprised too!

With the patch above the board appears to boot.
Without the patch, it doesn't.

Ok, so in that case the correct value for "sh_tmu.2" might actually
be MSTP016 or MSTP015 depending on the bundle size. I am unsure how to test
sh_tmu.2.

However, the documentation I have seems to talk about channels
being TMU0..TMU2 and control of them being via MSTP016..MSTP014.
I.e. what the code currently is but not what seems to work for
TMU1 in practice.
