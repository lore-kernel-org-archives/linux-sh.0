Maybe a little bit of both?

I don't want to carry anything that will collide with the stuff
harvested into ARM SoC through Simon.

Can you send a small set of self-contained patches that
do not touch anything in arch/arm/* and which does not
collide with anything already queued in ARM SoC for v3.11?

In that case I'd be happy to take it as some preparation
for v3.12.

Yours,
Linus Walleij
