That depends - sometimes creating generic stuff results in a net increase
in the overall size, and that's something that Linus also complained about.

According to linux-next, where we are at the moment with arch/arm is a
net increase of 6000 lines since the close of the last merge window,
and arch/arm is responsible for almost 75% of arch/ changes.  It looks
very much like the same situation which Linus complained about.

Can arch/arm continue to increase in size?  I think not.  We desperately
need patches which reduce the size of arch/arm, and we desperately need
them *now*.
