BTW, just verified in the current "next": all platforms, using cd-inverted 
or wp-inverted in the mainline

arch/arm/boot/dts/ccu9540.dts
arch/arm/boot/dts/ea3250.dts
arch/arm/boot/dts/phy3250.dts
arch/arm/boot/dts/snowball.dts
arch/arm/boot/dts/u9540.dts

use GPIO controllers with 2 or 3 cells.

Thanks
