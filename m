XIP_KERNEL=y and SMP=y can happen if the CPU you're booting on has the SMP
extensions.  In other words, it's a single CPU which was implemented with
the SMP extensions enabled, or it's part of a SMP set.

So, allowing both XIP_KERNEL=y and SMP=y is quite correct: however, folk
need to understand that the SMP option _must_ match the hardware they're
booting on.

I'm afraid quite a lot of it.  If you consider that the SMP alternatives
table is 0x5ee0 bytes long for my iMX6 kernel, and that each entry is
8 bytes, that's 3036 locations throughout the kernel text which need to
be fixed up for a SMP_ON_UP kernel.  They start at 0xc0012460, and
continue up to 0xc09ef31c.  That covers much of the kernel .text and
the .text.init sections.

In an XIP kernel, the .text locations will most likely be in read-only
memory, and so can't be fixed up.

Yes, that makes sense if we agree that we want to have multi-platform
XIP kernels.

The problem is going to be expressing what a set of valid configurations
are - soo many of them just won't boot.  For example, if any of the
multiplatforms select SMP, but you want a non-SMP XIP kernel, you have
to devine which platforms are forcibly selecting SMP and turn them off.
In some of the kernel configurators, that's almost impossible to find
out.

I guess the other problem is going to be that people will want to add a
set of reasonable defaults for CONFIG_PHYS_OFFSET based upon the
platform selected - and we know that we have problems with that kind of
thing when it comes to the DEBUG_LL stuff interacting with a multiplatform
kernel.
