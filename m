	Hi Simon, Magnus,

This patch series enables DT support for PM domains on the Renesas
R-Mobile APE6 (r8a73a4) SoC.

This series builds further upon the DT PM Domain support for R-Mobile
A1 (r8a7740) and SH-Mobile AG5 (sh73a0).  Due to the similarity of the
SYSC System-Controller on the various SH-Mobile/R-Mobile SoCs, and the
abstraction of PM domains in DT, the same driver can handle r8a73a4,
without any additional modifications, and without changing the DT
bindings.

Dependencies:
  1. Patch 1 (DT binding doc) depends on the R-Mobile DT PM Domain
     work for sh73a0, which depends on the multiplatform work for
     sh73a0, which is blocked on simple-pm-bus,
  2. Patch 2 (dtsi) depends on the multiplatform work for r8a73a4,
     which is blocked on simple-pm-bus,
  3. Patch 3 (drivers/sh) depends on all of the above.

This was tested on ape6evm-multiplatform.

Thanks for your comments!
