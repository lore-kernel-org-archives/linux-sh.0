I was more concerned about the clk_disable_unprepare() calls. The function is 
called through the uart pm handler which is called when closing the uart 
(uart_close()). It's a bit difficult to follow the dynamic code paths as I'm 
not very familiar with the framework, but I was concerned that the would end 
up calling clk_disable_unprepare() on a clock for which we have no reference 
anymore. What prevents clk_disable_unprepare() from being called in the close 
path after the device has been unbound ? And what ensures that the clocks get 
unprepared when unbinding the device if the port is held open by a userspace 
process ?
