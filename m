I've tried to boot in non-secure mode by modifying MD5 (DIP switch SW10), but 
it doesn't seem to have any influence.

I assume that the reason why I have to program the IPMMU non-secure page table 
is that the memory requests coming from the DU are considered as non-secure. 
That's just a guess though. Without a detailed description of how the hardware 
is supposed to work I can't improve the code and DT bindings.
