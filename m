Hi Andrew,

Thanks for your review!

My plan is to use this driver on SH-Mobile ARM (sh7372), and I'd be
happy to fix up the driver to become a bit less non-standard wrt
blocking compared to the other MMC host drivers. Is it possible that
Goda-san fixes up whatever minor bits that need rework and that you
pick up at that point?

I'd like to rework the MMCIF blocking code and perhaps also add
dmaengine support as feature patches on top of Goda-sans work if
that's ok with you. Better PM is also on the TODO. Not sure if any of
these features will make it in time for the 2.6.35 merge window
though.

It would be very useful to have the MMCIF driver as-is in 2.6.35
mainline to begin with if possible. Or do you think the driver needs
to be reworked more before that can happen?

Thanks,
