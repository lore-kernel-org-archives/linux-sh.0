Good point, I hadn't thought about that. However, shouldn't that case be 
handled by 2-stage translation instead ? The IPMMU hardware supports that, but 
the driver doesn't implement it yet.

Thank you. I won't have time to implement that feature for v3.16 though, given 
how close we are to the merge window.
