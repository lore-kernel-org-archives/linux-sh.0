Why? I don't have any idea why we should use only multi_v7_defconfig for each
hardware platform. In my understanding, multi_v7_defconfig can be used for one
kernel image can support all of the platforms but it doesn't mean it should be
used for each platform. And I think, if we cannot maintain each platform's
defconfig in mainline, it will be kept in each SoC vendor and it is not a good
way. I mean both defconfigs has each value in mainline, exynos_defconfig should
be updated though ;)

Agreed and it is not required.
