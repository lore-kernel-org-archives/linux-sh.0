We have now an old and new infrastructure in place to handle hotplug
notifications while a CPU goes up and/or down. We want to get rid of the
old infrastructure and are converting its users away.

PREPARE + STARTING states require static ids. The online callback has
dynamic allocations of ids since it was assumed that this is the most
common one.
We will most likely evaluate the situation once we done and total number
of IDS are not acceptable.
