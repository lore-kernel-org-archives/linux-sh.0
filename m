Well, don't think we had a generic way to handle this until now. Each 
driver handles GPIOs in its own way. The GPIO API only provides functions 
to reserve GPIOs, specify their direction (out / in) and set or get level 
respectively. Besides you could set some flags like GPIOF_OPEN_DRAIN etc. 
After a driver, say, reads low level of a GPIO it has to decide itself 
whether it's the "on" or the "off" level, for which many drivers often use 
their own means to specify GPIO's "polarity."

Right, but the MMC core already has a generic MMC_CAP2_RO_ACTIVE_HIGH 
flag, so, this flag is redundant. Perhaps, the SDHCI OF glue will have to 
set that flag if the MMC core reports MMC_CAP2_RO_ACTIVE_HIGH.

Right, which is already a mess...

We can do that, sure, but I'm not sure we really have to apply both to end 
up with a non-inverted pin, or just interpret it as resundant information 
and invert once.

Ok, as soon as we agree on handling of the double inversion, I'll prepare 
and post an updated patch series.
