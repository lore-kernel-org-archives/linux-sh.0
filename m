input: mode 6 patches for sh_keysc

[PATCH 01/03] input: break out hw access functions in sh_keysc 
[PATCH 02/03] input: bitmap update for sh_keysc
[PATCH 03/03] input: update sh_keysc driver with mode 6

These patches improve the sh_keysc driver with mode 6 support.

The earlier submitted patch for mode 4 and mode 5 extended the
driver with up to 6 * 7 keys. Mode 6 support included in this
patch set allows up to 7 * 7 keys.

The sh_keysc driver has so far only been used with hardware
where the number of keys can fit in a 32-bit bitmap, but from
mode 4 and up these 32 bits are no longer enough. To address
this proper bitmaps are made use of instead 32-bit integers.
