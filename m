Hi,

this is an update of a series posted by Ulrich,
"ARM: shmobile: various DT files sorted by address",
the purpose of which is to sort DT nodes by their address.

Changes since v1.
* Some patches from the v1 series have been queued up and thus are not
  present in v2.
* Two new patches have been added to remove spurious regulator base
  addresses, as suggested by Geert Uytterhoeven. These correct incorrect
  lines before subsequent patches, rebased since v1, move them.

Based on renesas-next-20140916v2-v3.17-rc2.
Targeted for inclusion in v3.19.
