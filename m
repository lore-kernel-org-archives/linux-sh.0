config SPARSE_IRQ
	bool "Support sparse irq numbering" if MAY_HAVE_SPARSE_IRQ

and change all the existing 'HAVE_SPARSE_IRQ' to MAY_HAVE_SPARSE_IRQ
except those where SPARSE_IRQ gets selected.

In other words, on ARM get rid of HAVE_SPARSE_IRQ=y, don't select
MAY_HAVE_SPARSE_IRQ instead, but have each converted machine select
SPARSE_IRQ directly.  Then, people who want sparse irq to be a
question can have their cake.  While we can eat our cake too.

As a side-note, you may be pleased to know that I have SA11x0 stuff
converted to (and tested) with sparse IRQ.  That's with SA1111, the
UCB1x00 and Neponset expansion board for the Assabet all dynamically
allocating their IRQs.  The only fixed-numbered IRQs in SA11x0 in my
tree at the time of writing are the on-SoC IRQs, and the LoCoMo IRQs
(which I don't have the hardware to test for, so I'm not touching.)

Note that SA1111 support is fairly broken in current mainline because
of a half-completed (but still merged) patch which results in SA1111
overwriting IRQ0-55 with its own handlers.  Ouch.

This is /proc/interrupts for the Assabet+Neponset, with 49 SA11x0,
3 Neponset, 55 SA1111, and 16 UCB1300 IRQs:
