I'm not strongly attached to the name, and I do see your point.  But as it
stands the hook is currently only needed on 16bit register writes; the hook
is called from sd_ctrl_write16(): and sh_mobile_sdhi_write16_hook() works
by looking at addr, which is specific to register reads and writes.  So
while it isn't great, I think the current name isn't entirely horrible.

I think its a little hard to look into a crystal ball and see
where other TMIO hardware might need wait_idle(). Who knows
what we might need to do for the next batch of hardware? :-)

I had considered other approaches to this problem, such as
calling something_wait_idle() from within tmio_mmc_*.c as needed.
But the approach in the patch I posted turned out to be quite
a lot cleaner and have the advantage of concisely documenting
what is being done - that is, writes to which registers need
wait_idle treatment.

The down side is that the callback is obviously more specific
than perhaps a hook ought to be. But I think that it can evolve
as the need arises.
