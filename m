Please don't pull the renesas-drivers-2015-12-14-v4.4-rc5 tag, else you'll
import half of linux-next plus some v4.6 stuff ;-)

You can pull the topic/scif-clk-sck-brg-core-v3 branch, though, which is
just this series.

Let's formalize, cfr. below.
Thanks a lot!

Hi Greg,

The following changes since commit 8005c49d9aea74d382f474ce11afbbc7d7130bec:

  Linux 4.4-rc1 (2015-11-15 17:00:27 -0800)

are available in the git repository at:

  git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/geert/renesas-drivers.git

for you to fetch changes up to 830fe6beabc4ab6e4a0f8a688c5a150af69dd95e:

  serial: sh-sci: Drop the sci_fck clock fallback (2015-12-14 13:14:43 +0100)

Summary:
  - Clean up the naming of clocks in the sh-sci driver and its DT bindings,
  - Add support for the optional external clock on (H)SCI(F), where this pin
    can serve as a clock input,
  - Add support for the optional clock sources for the Baud Rate
    Generator for External Clock (BRG), as found on some SCIF variants
    and on HSCIF.

Thanks for pulling!
