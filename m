I actually did just that in my first local attempt, but I decided not
to since it will only cause potential breakage.

Is there any particular reason why you want shorter names?

From my side, I prefer to keep the names in sync with the data sheet.
In this particular case it is a shared pin so OVC is used for Host
while VBUS is used for gadget, so if you're proposing to ditch VBUS
then this feels somewhat inconsistent with the current gadget use
case. =)

Thanks,
