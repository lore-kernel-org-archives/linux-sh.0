Hi Guennadi,

Thanks for your work on this. In general I am quite happy about this series.

One rather significant question is however this: Would it be possible
for you to check if the TWD is operating as expected when you scale
the CPU Frequency? I suspect it is not, so please cook up a v3 of this
series that also includes updates for timers.

Cheers,
