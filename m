ARM: shmobile: r8a73a4 SoC and APE6EVM board support

[PATCH 01/04] ARM: shmobile: Initial r8a73a4 SoC support
[PATCH 02/04] ARM: shmobile: r8a73a4 SCIF support
[PATCH 03/04] ARM: shmobile: r8a73a4 IRQC support
[PATCH 04/04] ARM: shmobile: APE6EVM support

This series adds initial support for r8a73a4 and APE6EVM. The SoC
is known as r8a73a4 which is built around Cortex-A15 and makes use
of SCIF for serial and IRQC interrupt controller for external IRQs.

This initial SoC and board support is providing limited DT-only
support and a very basic C-version of board support. In the future
improved PINCTRL and clock framework support will be added, followed
by SMP support.
