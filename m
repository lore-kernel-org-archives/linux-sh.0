Hi Kaneko-san, Mizuguchi-san,

That indeed seems to be true, and that's what this patch is changing.

However, page 64-2 doesn't mention the MP clock for USB-DMAC:
   "AXI bus clock (ZSφ: 260 MHz), HPB bus clock (HPφ: 130 MHz).
    USB local bus clock (48 MHz)"
So your statement doesn't seem to be true?

Note that mstp3_clks in dtsi has hp_clk as the parent for both usbdmac0 and
usbdmac1, so if your statement would be true, that has to changed, too?

The same is true for other members of the R-Car Gen2 family, e.g. your patch
for r8a7791.
