Hi Greg, Hi All,

this short series adds HSCIF support to the sh-sci driver
and enhances the r8a7790 SoC to not use external clocks for SCIF.

I have included these two patches in a single series as the second
patch has a build-time dependency on the first.

Greg, would it be possible for you to review at least the first patch and
if it is ok either:
* Ack the first patch so I can merge it through the renesas tree or;
* Take both patches, I have supplied Acks.

In the case of the latter I can supply a pull request if you like.
