Actually this cannot happen.  The driver must use the PMB driver to 
request a mapping, and that mapping cannot be modified by user-space or 
any other drivers.
Since the PMB only remaps address starting from 0x80000000 (which is 
outside of the DRAM address space supported by the PMB enabled shmobile 
devices), only drivers that intentionally use addresses within the PMB 
range will have their data remapped.

By requesting a mapping by specifying the size and mapping destination 
to the PMB driver, a driver will effectively lock a region of the PMB 
address space for its own use.  Since the specific region that is locked 
is decided by the PMB driver, no other device can make changes to the 
mappings in that region.

For example:
1. Driver A requests a PMB remap to address addr1 with a size of 16M
2. The PMB driver will allocate a region in the PMB address area to hold 
the mapping (eg. 0x80000000 - 0x80000000 + 16M - 1)
3. Driver A accesses addr1 by specifying a DMA address of 0x80000000 to
the hardware

If another client (driver instance, user space, etc) tries to create 
another mapping, the PMB driver allocates that request to an unused
memory region (perhaps 0x80000000 + 64M). If there are no available
regions left, the request will fail.

user-space drivers.
