Hmm, interesting. We still have to handle the case where a mapping created
with one page-size could be unmapped with another though (in particular,
unmapping part of the range).

Is this an assumption that's relied on by other IOMMU drivers? It
certainly makes mapping of large ranges less efficient than it could be, so
I'm more inclined to set all the bits > PAGE_SIZE in pgsize_bitmap if it's
only used to determine the granularity at which map/unmap are called (which
is unrelated to what the hardware can actually do).
