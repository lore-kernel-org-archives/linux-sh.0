sata_car.txt is added by the previous patch in this series

An example is present.

I have included the text of sata_rcar.txt below to aid review:

---- begin sata_rcar.txt ----
* Renesas R-Car SATA

Required properties:
- compatible           : should contain "renesas,sata-r8a7779";
- reg                  : offset and length of the SATA registers;
- interrupts           : must consist of one interrupt specifier.

Example:

sata: sata@fc600000 {
	compatible = "renesas,sata-r8a7779";
	reg = <0xfc600000 0x2000>;
	interrupt-parent = <&gic>;
	interrupts = <0 100 0x4>;
};
