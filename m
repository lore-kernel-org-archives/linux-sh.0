The patches [1-3/5] are ok (reviewed only) excepted some remarks I have.

That looks like a disclaimer ;p

There is some code for OMAP that dynamically updates the worst case
values for devices activation and de-activation;
cf._omap_device_activate and _omap_device_deactivate in
arch/arm/plat-omap/omap_device.c. The idea is to start with reference
figures (worst case measured on board) at boot and then update the
worst case values at runtime.
Based on the PM QoS values and the worst case latency values the next
power domains states can be determined. Unfortunately this is not
(yet) implemented.

I am wondering if the patches [4-5/5] are meant to replace the OMAP
code, which would be really nice.
