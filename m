Thanks, I discovered that after writing my previous email.
I think it is an approach well suited to the needs of kzm9g
and I intend to use it.

Oh, I will look into that.

Magnus's suggestion was to register the names that DT will use
in the clock .c file.

In either case I think we can get rid of auxdata.
