The locking is there to protect against the interrupt handler accessing
the port->* stuff (which seems to have been forgotten by the cpm driver).

I don't see any reason why clk_set_rate() needs to be under the spinlock
there - we need the reprogramming of the baud rate within the spinlock
on 8250 because of DLAB bit hiding the data registers.  It's also a good
idea that it _is_ within the spinlock along with uart_update_timeout()
to ensure timeouts and the baud rate are updated together.
