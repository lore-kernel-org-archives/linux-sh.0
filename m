Yeah, my qemu invocation for sh4 is a bit eldrich, I got it from the
qemu mailing list. Possibly from:

https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2007-09/msg00530.html

The really _fun_ thing about this is qemu broke it a couple years back
and now if you hit ctrl-c it kills the _emulator_ rather than passing it
through to the Linux console. (Just sh4, the rest do it right.)

I complained about it on the qemu mailing list in 2014 but nobody there
cared:

http://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2014-09/msg00000.html

Of course that's actually _useful_ for the testing I'm doing now because
when the kernel tries to shut down qemu it goes:

  / # exit
  reboot: Restarting system
  Unauthorized access

And then hangs eating 100% cpu. (Wheee!)

Very likely given how crappy the rest of its serial emulation is for
this architecture, but ever since qemu added glib support I've stopped
trying to understand their developers' thought processes.

The current code has been further complicated by two more commits
(039403765 and 90afa5255) doing who knows what, but deleting the
"scif_set_rtrg(port, s->rx_trigger);" from sci_reset() does appear to
fix the problem.
