Because in an interactive system running at 60fps, you only have 16ms
budget per frame. During the blanking interval when you receive the
IRQ you need to immediately start the DMA. If you defer to a workqueue
and schedule you are practically guaranteeing to never run at 60fps
(more like 30 if you are consistently late, which you would with that
kind of timing and even a mildly busy system).
