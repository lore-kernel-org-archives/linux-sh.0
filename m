Typo: 0x43000000 should be 0x42000000 I guess.

Since you control the mapping, I wonder if you could also do this as

               dma-ranges = <0x42000000 0 0x00000000 0 0x40000000 0 0x80000000
                             0x43000000 0 0x80000000 1 0x80000000 0 0x80000000>;

i.e. map all the RAM into PCI bus addresses below the 32-bit boundary.
This would be really nice from the perspective that now all PCI
devices could access all of RAM without using an IOMMU or the
relying on 64-bit master capability.

The downside of this is that you'd probably need a custom dma_map_ops
wrapper.
