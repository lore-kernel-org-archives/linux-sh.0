(cc'ing Jonsoo and Christoph; summary: slab failure with L1_CACHE_BYTES
of 128 and sizeof(kmem_cache_node) of 152)

If I revert commit 8fc9cf420b36 ("slab: make more slab management
structure off the slab") it works but I still need to figure out how
slab indices are calculated. The size_index[] array is overridden so
that 0..15 are 7 and 16..23 are 8. But the kmalloc_caches[7] has never
been populated, hence the BUG_ON. Another option may be to change
kmalloc_size and kmalloc_index to cope with KMALLOC_MIN_SIZE of 128.

I'll do some more investigation tomorrow.
