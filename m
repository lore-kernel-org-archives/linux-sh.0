My thinking behind separating this out was that I wanted this
define to be accessible from user space.  The reason is so that
an application can test the value of .nonstd against the flag to
know for sure if it is dealing with a YUV framebuffer or not.
I was under the impression that only headers under include/linux/ should 
be accessed from user space, but to be honest, I'm not sure about that.
If that is in fact not the case, then I totally agree that it can go
into include/video/sh_mobile_lcdc.h.
Do you know where the proper place for such a header would be?
