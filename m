Works for me. That would also remove the need for the platform init to request then free
the GPIO just to set the debounce.

Make sure you do the gpiu_set_debounce() after the GPIO has been requested or you
trigger a WARN due to the auto-requested GPIO. Then, of course, the drivers gpio request
will fail...

I'll give it a test when you post it.

Thanks,
Hartley
