One question/comment about setting the value of nonstd.
Ideally, when an application reads the nonstd field from 
fb_var_screeninfo, it would need to be sure that the value corresponds 
to a YUV setting instead of some other valid non-zero nonstd value, 
right? So maybe defining a bitmask for the YUV bit somewhere accessible 
from user space would be beneficial (perhaps a new file, 
linux/sh_mobile_fb.h, which might also be a good place to define any 
ioctls that might be used in future, for blending for example).
It seems that for both sh7372 and sh7724 that bit would be bit 16 in 
LDDFR, which is nice. As for the remaining bits, which are chip 
dependent, I was thinking that it would be good to define similar 
mask/flags and "or" them all together to build up nonstd.  The question 
is where to define these.  There are separate files for mach/sh7724.h 
and mach/sh7372.h, which I though might fit nicely or would it be better 
to define flags for both chips in video/sh_mobile_lcdc.h?
