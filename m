Correct in principle. Sometimes however we decide to put things into
a different branch than what you had planned, and this is what happened
here when Olof put the dt-cleanup into next/dt, which we normally do
for pull requests that only touch the dts files.

Thanks for the explanation. I think the best way forward is to just
classify both renesas-dt-cleanups-for-v3.19 and renesas-koelsch-board-removal-for-v3.19
as cleanups then, which I've done. The dt-cleanup is now in both
next/cleanup and next/dt, while dt-cleanup2 and dt-cleanup3 remain
just in next/dt.
