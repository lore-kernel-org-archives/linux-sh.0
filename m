So I will resubmit the HDMI fix.

There are two options:
  1. Drop the two patches that introduce the D4 and A4MP PM domains,
  2. Amend the patches that introduce the D4 and A4MP PM domains to
     comment out the entries in the table in pm-r8a7740.c, like was done in
     the first submission.

Both will cause conflicts when applying the successive patches.

If you don't care about bisectability, you can implement option 2 as a
separate change, after applying the whole series.
