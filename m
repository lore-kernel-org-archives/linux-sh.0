In that case the clock-specifier is simply zero cells (though admittedly
a pair including a zero-cells element is a bit odd).

The wording in the patch is consistent with the form I've been
recommending elsewhere:

- clocks: A list of phandles + clock-specifier pairs, one for each
  entry in clock-names.
- clock-names: Should contain:
  * "fclk" - the functional clock
  * "other_clk" - some other clock.

I would certainly like to see consistent wording across bindings
(especially for interrupts given the addition of the interrupts-extended
binding).

Cheers,
Mark.
