I'm not sure I see what the problem is. If there is no special lookup
matching this clock to the device pointer then the lookup will resolve to
whatever generically provides that clock. There is also nothing that
stops someone from providing the same clock to multiple devices via the
same lookup string, this is largely what clock lookups are for in the
first place. Any move away from a device pointer to clk_get() is a step
in the wrong direction.
