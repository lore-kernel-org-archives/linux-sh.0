I'm not sure how safe this is - there are some drivers using mc146818rtc.h
which get their IRQ via this header file (it's known as RTC_IRQ.)  So we
need to verify that nothing breaks as a result of that definition going
away when this file is included.

It looks like it's just drivers/char/rtc.c, which we don't use anymore
on ARM.  So this should be safe.

It might be worth adding:

#define RTC_IRQ BUILD_BUG_ON(true)

or something like that, to catch any users of it (even though that'll then
cause drivers/char/rtc.c to fail if built on ARM, which it shouldn't be.)
