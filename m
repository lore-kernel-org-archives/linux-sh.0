Doesn't have to be in the base struct tho. I think a better approach is
to keep the base struct reasonably API-only, and have an
"implementation" subclass called something like simple_clk for example,
that carries those few fields common to most MMIO based implementation
and which can be created with existing "helper" code for the most common
ones.
