Thanks for the clarification.

For mach-shmobile the three major components that rely on entity
mapped memory maps are SMP, clocks and power domains. The clocks
should really be moved in the common direction and I intend to get
people to focus on that in the not too distant future (next 6 months).
Power domains should be rather easy to convert. SMP tends to be a bit
of a headache because last time I checked I couldn't use ioremap() at
->smp_init_cpus() time. What I recall is that ioremap() hanged instead
of returning something.

Anyway, if I track down the ioremap() issue, would it be possible for
you to check if it can be reproduced on some other sub-architecture?

Thanks,
