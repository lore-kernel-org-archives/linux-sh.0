I've read through
https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/driver-api/dmaengine/client.rst twice
and am still very unclear on the slave API.

Only sort of. In 4.14 at least it's under #ifdef ARCH_PXA and full of PXA
constants (PXAD_PRIO_LOWEST and such).

Bookmarked, thanks.

(Being able to just upgrade to a 4.19 kernel or something and have DMA work in
this driver if I've got dmaengine set up for the platform would be lovely.)

The sh7760 has the CPU pegged at 100% trying to keep up with ethernet traffic.
Being able to use DMA on this would be very nice.

This driver's the low-hanging fruit, yeah. Copying NOR flash jffs2 data into
page cache would be nice but there's a decompression step so I'm not sure that's
a win.

What are "all platforms" in this context? I tried to find an x86 variant that
uses DMAEngine but came up empty. Can I use DMAEngine on a raspberry pi perhaps?
Is there a QEMU taret I can play with DMAEngine under?

I built a mainstone kernel with dmaengine amd smc91x both enabled, and booted it
on qemu-system-arm -M mainstone, and it works fine until I try to ping the host
(via the 10.0.2.2 redirect), at which point no packets are received and a timer
expires all over the console a few seconds later. I.E. the DMA claims to be
there, but the transfer never occurs.

I built and tested every Linux version back to 4.2 (before the smc91x was
converted from PXA dma to use DMAEngine, albeit in a very PXA specific manner).
I also tested each qemu release back to 2.3.0, with no obvious behavioral
difference.

I can dig further back in qemu history maybe? Ask on the qemu list? (Did this
ever work for anyone? I can post my kernel config and qemu command line if you
think it would help?)

I do not understand what the slave map is for, is it documented anywhere? (The
Documentation/randomdir/dmaengine/client.nolongertxt file says: "The association
is done via DT, ACPI or board file based dma_slave_map matching table." which is
its only mention of the existence of dma_slave_map.

If the driver just needs "a channel" and doesn't care which one, why isn't the
config info for that channel in the driver as a generic request for resource?

I have not.
