As I'm feeling the need to add gic_set_irqchip_flags(IRQCHIP_SKIP_SET_WAKE)
for more shmobile SoCs (which implies populating mach_desc.init_irq()
again, and also calling irqchip_init() explicitly), I'm wondering if it
wouldn't be better to just initialize "gic_chip.flags = IRQCHIP_SKIP_SET_WAKE"
unconditionally?
Currently the GIC driver doesn't have to do anything special to support
wake-up, but support for that may be added one day.

Every driver that wants to implements wake-up properly should call
irq_set_irq_wake() or {en,dis}able_irq_wake() to inform the upstream interrupt
controller. However, with GIC, that gives (except on sh73a0, r8a7779,
ux500, and zynq) annoying warning messages during resume:

    WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 1341 at kernel/irq/manage.c:540
irq_set_irq_wake+0x9c/0xf8()
    Unbalanced IRQ 26 wake disable

I guess I could just leave out the call to irq_set_irq_wake() in my GPIO driver,
as it works fine without, but that doesn't look correct to me.

What do you think?

Thanks!
