ARM: shmobile: Per-CPU SMP boot / sleep code

[PATCH 01/02] ARM: shmobile: Introduce per-CPU SMP boot / sleep code
[PATCH 02/02] ARM: shmobile: Per-CPU SMP boot / sleep code for SCU SoCs

This series adds per-CPU SMP boot / sleep code to mach-shmobile and ties
it in with the Cortex-A9 SoCs using the shared SCU code. With this code
in place mach-shmobile has a common per-CPU demuxer that CPUs to start
from and a place where CPUs also go to sleep (perhaps forever).
