Hi Saravana,

> Shouldn't you be grabbing the prepare_lock here?

This depends on semantics that (as far as I can tell) aren't defined yet. We 
may even want to disallow set_rate (and set_parent) when prepare_count is non-
zero.

Ideally, we should work out what the semantics are with regards to changing a 
clock's rate when it has multiple users and/or is enabled or prepared, but 
that's a separate issue, and we should *definitely* implement that as a 
separate change.

I'd prefer to enforce the 'sleepability' with might_sleep instead.

It's not, but that's the only thing it's protecting in the common code. I'm 
open for better names, but resource_lock is too generic.

Again, this is related to set_rate during enable/disable or prepare/unprepare; 
we don't have defined semantics for this at present.

This took some reading through c99, but yes, it looks like we can drop these 
zero initialisations.

However, the coding style convention for the implicit zeroing of static 
variables is to allow these variables to be put into the .bss section, 
reducing object size. In this case, the clock will never be able to go into 
.bss (it has non-zero elements too), and so this will have no change on object 
size. I prefer to be explicit here, and show that the counts are initialised 
to zero.

I'm happy to go either way. I have a preference for the explicit 
initialisation, but that may not be general style.

That's correct. For an array of clocks, you'll have to use a different 
initialiser. We can add helpers for that that when (and if) the need arises.

I think "blocking" is generally accepted as is intended in this case, but it's 
probably better to be explicit here.

Ah, yes, I'll update this.
