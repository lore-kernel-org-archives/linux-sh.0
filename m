I don't think it's supposed to care. Soem of the upper bits of the ranges
only really make sense of PCI device registers, not for the top-level
ranges property. The driver can however still look at the address itself
to get that information.

But the ranges you specified in the property don't actually fit in those
constraints: you have a range with size 0x8000000 and start 0x40000000,
which you say can't be programmed into the hardware.

I was thinking more of PCI devices than the host itself. If the host
driver can verify that all mappings are in the first 4GB and cover all of
RAM, we won't have to use an swiotlb for devices that don't support 64-bit
DMA, which is a very significant performance difference.
