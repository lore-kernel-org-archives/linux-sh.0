It's not touching clkdev, the comment is somewhat misleading and is
mostly based on me thinking about how we'd deploy off-SoC clocks.
There's also the diagnostic issues Sacha mentioned, if we don't keep
some source information handy it's hard to tell what clock logging is
talking about.

We do need some way to have some idea which clocks we're talking about,
and for off-SoC stuff passing around struct clk pointers is rather
painful.  At some point some bit of code is going to have to get hold of
the actual struct clk and then map it onto the devices using it.

For device tree we should be able to do that fairly painlessly with just
the struct devices, without device tree you either have to have the
structs handy or use names.  At the minute the infrastructure is
somewhat lacking here.
