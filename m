Hi Laurent,

Thanks for V2, it is looking better and better. Great that r8a7791 and
r8a7790 can share the CPG code. I have now finally got my r8a7791
board replaced so I intend to try your code out on Lager and then see
if I can cook something up on Koelsch.

I have one question related to the CPG. What is your plan regarding
CPU Frequency scaling? I'd like to see "z_clk" and "z2_clk"
implemented together with some way to let CPUFreq scale "z_clk". Can
you please spend some time on that?

Cheers,

/ magnus
