Russell,

In your first reply to Jeremy you said this:
"I will take it, but at the moment I'm rather unhappy about the response
from the community to Linus' complaint."

So, if you are going to pull in his patches for the next merge, you can 
ignore this most of this email.

Talking for MSM, I'm waiting for some kind of certainty that these APIs 
will not be changed again before I rework our clock code to it. Even if 
I decide to move to this new framework without that certainty, it's 
going to be hard to convince driver teams to start using this new API if 
it's not already accepted upstream. At which point we would be back to 
square one -- "we need to see drivers (clock consumers) use these new 
APIs/rework before we pull it in".

Long story short, it's exactly the chicken and egg problem Nicolas was 
talking about and we need to break the egg :-)

Also, Jeremy's changes are more than just consolidation. They add 
clk_prepare/clk_unprepare APIs and those would be quite beneficial to 
quite a few machs/archs.

I'm sure lines of code is important, but saying we won't add any 
architectural improvements because it adds LOC seems backwards. If we go 
by that policy, the end result would be a freeze of the kernel.

Btw, what's your position on device tree for ARM? Device tree should 
help out a lot with clock data taking up too many LOCs.

Thanks,
Saravana
