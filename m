There's no special binding specific to cpus. Yes the generic binding
should be fine as we don't have to deal with their configuration in the
kernel and assumed to be all preconfigured by early secure boot code.

Interesting, only PL2xx/3xx cache controller driver reads this from the
DT and configures the controller. The integrated L2 found in
A15/A7/A57/A53 needs doesn't make use of these values from the DT.

I assume these values are tested and configured by boot loaders before
entering Linux. I am not objecting to their presence here but I am
mentioning that it's mostly of no use for Linux as software running at
higher EL might not allow these configuration to be modified.
