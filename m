Hi Magnus,

Ok, while the overall patchset looks good, I still had trouble with
the dx, dy, w, h stuff. It had me a bit confused. The above comment
about keeping track of the dirty area made me realize why I think that
portion can be improved. The reason is that we already have a pagelist
to track touched pages and the dx, dy, w, h stuff duplicates that. I
have an idea of how we can avoid this duplication which I'll sketch
below.

As you have noticed, doing it using x, y, w, h results in needing to
do things like INT_MAX above and side effects like dx != -1 in the
client drivers. I think that we can avoid this. Instead, I would
prepare the pagelist directly in write, imageblit, etc since we know
exactly which pages have been touched.

I guess this would be better explained if I posted some sample code
rather than just talking about it so I'll do a quick and dirty
implementation for write only in metronomefb so that we can discuss
this further.

Thanks,
jaya
