While VFIO is still out-of-tree, it handles this use-case, as well as
interrupts and transparent DMA remapping via the IOMMU. I'm using it
on a current project and it works as advertised. UIO is in-tree and
also handles this (as I understand it), but without DMA or interrupt
support.

It's perhaps arguable whether any human with taste should ship a
driver based on UIO/VFIO, but for code that exists solely to exercise
and test a hardware design, it works great.
