There's two of them. The series replaces platform data fields for platform 
device resources (for memory I/O region address and IRQs) and other platform 
data fields (for baud rate calculation information). This requires modifying 
the driver first to support the new method of passing information, followed by 
modifying the platforms to use it, and finally removing the old method from 
the driver.

As all sh-sci driver patches will go through Simon's tree for this kernel 
release, and as the series has been acked by Greg as the serial tree 
maintainer, I believe this should not be a problem from a merge perspective.
