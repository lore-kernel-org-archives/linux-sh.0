Apologies for that. I'm trying to pick back up on things now, now that
I've got both some downtime from other things and funding for core sh
maintenance stuff. If you know any issues you'd especially like me to
put my attention on now, please let me know. I have a few patches
queued up from myself and others, but I believe there's a lot more I
haven't been able to get to for quite a while. I should have new SH
hardware to test on soon and in the meantime I've improved my qemu
setup.

One question I have about this specific patch is why any code is
needed at all. Why can't __stack_chk_guard just be moved to
initialized data, or left uninitialized, for the compressed kernel
image loader? Assuming it is needed, the code looks ok, but I question
the premise.
