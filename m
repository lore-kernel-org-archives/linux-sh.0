Yes, you are right.

Ok, I had missed that, but the driver certainly looks good to me.

Ok. And I guess the EMMA EV2 uses only GIC but not IRQC or INTC, right?

Yes, obviously.

Coming back to INTC, are you planning to use the same binding for A and C?
Which of them the binding you posted earlier for?

When I looked at the existing code, I had the impression that doing a
binding for just the SH-Mobile SoCs that have an ARM core in them 
(including those that also have an SH core) would be much easier than
doing a binding that also covers the older SH SoCs, since those are
much less uniform.
