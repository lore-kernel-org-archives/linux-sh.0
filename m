Indeed. And if I look at it with my KVM hat on, it is even worse (the
guest will exit all the way to platform emulation in userspace on each
sched_clock read - a sure performance killer).

Of course, emulating a VE is not the best option, but that's all we have
so far when using QEMU as platform emulation.
