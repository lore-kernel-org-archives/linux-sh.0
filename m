"regulator0" and "regulator1"?
"regulator1v8" and "regulator3v3"?

Documentation/devicetree/bindings/regulator/regulator.txt doesn't mention
node names or (presence/lack of) unit-adresses, but the examples do have
unit-addresses.

Is this another case where we don't follow the "no reg, no unit-address"
ePAPR rule?
