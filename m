ARM: shmobile: Clean up the EMEV2 and KZM9D code base

[PATCH 01/03] ARM: shmobile: Remove legacy EMEV2 SoC support
[PATCH 02/03] ARM: shmobile: Remove KZM9D board code
[PATCH 03/03] ARM: shmobile: Get rid of legacy KZM9D defconfig

These patches clean up the EMEV2 SoC and the KZM9D board support code.

With these patches applied:
 - EMEV2 is enabled for the MULTIPLATFORM case only, making use of CCF
 - KZM9D is implemented as DT code only, no C code exists
 - The legacy EMEV2 code is gone, so is the legacy clock framework code
 - The legacy defconfig is gone, making way for a shared multiplatform defconfig

This means that KZM9D support comes without a Kconfig entry. Also,
the load address for u-boot needs to be supplied by hand (0x40008000).
