Hi Arnd,

I wonder if such consolidation only makes sense for boards that
make use of DT. If so, I can see that we may be able to come
up with a single configuration for the Armadillo800eva, KZM9G
and KZM9D boards. But not for older boards such as the Mackerel which
have not been converted to use DT.

I am also wondering if more of the drivers that SH Mobile uses need to
become DT aware before a consolidated configuration can work.  In
particular, I am thinking about the SCI serial driver and the location of
the serial port that can be used for serial console and early printk - this
features in the kernel command line of the per-board defconfigs and is
relied on by developers.
