And APE6 :-)

There was discussion (for all SoCs) about the presence of the arm,data-latency
and arm,tag-latency properties. Given the mess^H^H^H^H presence or
absence of virtualization they may or may not be valid...

I think the way forward (keeping the dependency for SYSC PM Domains in mind) is
to apply the series, after removing the controversial latency properties.

Should I resend, or can/will you handle that?

Thanks!
