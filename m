Interesting, thanks for running these tests. Two things cross my mind:

1) Can you try a different SDHC Class 10 card? I'd just simply buy a
top-of-the-line SanDisk card myself and try that, but anything
different from what you're having is probably useful as a contrast.

2) How about the MMC4.0 down-clocking. Is there anything we can do
about that software-wise?

Cheers,
