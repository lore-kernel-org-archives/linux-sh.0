I imagine they are primarily used by developers, like myself, but
to be honest I am unsure. Ideally I would like the defconfig to be as
useful as possible out of the box. But I agree that most users probably
end up making some customisations, e.g. to the location of the rootfs.

Thanks, I will look into that.
