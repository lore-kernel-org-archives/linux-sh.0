Personally, I took the view that they where never allowable from an
atomic context. We may need to lock the relevant clock hardware and
as such it makes it a bit of a headache if we have clock implementations
which communicate via something like i2c or spi. It could be that
clocks are sourced form some form of PMIC, PLL or other external device.

Is the DMA clock seperate from the device bus clock in this case?

IIRC, the I2C APIs aren't call-able from an atomic context, so the
clk_enable() and clk_disable() calls could be done from the context
initiating and completing the transaction, and not the interrupt
handler.

Hmm, either the lock has to be explicitly for the 'enable' count or
we end up with some really nasty locking problems.

I'd like to see some comment about the use of the clk_ api from atomic
context, and then sorting this out before we try and get a unified API
sorted out.

Some of that is implementation specific, IIRC if they can't return an
error they should be able to. In the case of most of the Samsung code
the user is allowed to set_parent and set_rate on a running clock, and
in some cases the clock has to be temporarily stopped whilst the MUX
change is being sorted out.

For the child case, on the Samsung code it is very rare that we've
ended up having to change the rate of the parent clocks, as we often
have fixed-rate sources for the child clocks, and thus use these as
a really useful stable source. Often the set_rate and the set_parent
calls are being done on the child clocks directly connected to the
peripherals.

I would propose that if we do have a common clk_api, then we have a
common set of notifiers (a-la, or use the current in kernel ones)
that can be called when a clock changes rate so that drivers can take
notice of this. It may be also a good idea for drivers to register
a range of clock rates they can tolerate so that setting the rate of
the parent can take these into account.

(On the above, I belive someone at ST has alreayd been looking at
 this sort of thing, but their implementation was rather large and
 needed a pile of tidying up).

However, I think we should carefully sort out who handles the set_parent
implementation, whether it is in the clk core api, or has at-least
a useful helper in there to ensure that the following is met:

- when parent changes, the parent's child count is changed
- if the child is enabled, the following needs to be done:
  - call clk_enable() for the new parent
  - call the implementation's set_parent
  - call clk_disbale() for the old parent

I believe this sort of thing is very useful to have in the core
implemetation, as it is the sort of thing people will get wrong
on a regular basis, as well as being common to all but the simplest
of clock implementations.

note, this may then cause problems on how you deal with a system
which has booted and is just setting the clocks up, as we may end
up disabling a clock that is being used elsewhere (but we just
don't know it).

second note, this is also even more fun for resume, where clock
control registers may not have been kept over resume. Simply
rewriting these registers from store may end up causing problems
with glitching clocks, etc.
