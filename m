Seems like we can use some consistency:

$ git grep -w model -- $(git grep -l renesas, -- arch/arm/boot/dts)
arch/arm/boot/dts/emev2-kzm9d.dts:      model = "EMEV2 KZM9D Board";
arch/arm/boot/dts/r7s72100-genmai.dts:  model = "Genmai";
arch/arm/boot/dts/r8a73a4-ape6evm.dts:  model = "APE6EVM";
arch/arm/boot/dts/r8a7740-armadillo800eva.dts:  model = "armadillo 800 eva";
arch/arm/boot/dts/r8a7778-bockw-reference.dts:  model = "bockw";
arch/arm/boot/dts/r8a7778-bockw.dts:    model = "bockw";
arch/arm/boot/dts/r8a7779-marzen.dts:   model = "marzen";
arch/arm/boot/dts/r8a7790-lager.dts:    model = "Lager";
arch/arm/boot/dts/r8a7791-henninger.dts:        model = "Henninger";
arch/arm/boot/dts/r8a7791-koelsch.dts:  model = "Koelsch";
arch/arm/boot/dts/r8a7794-alt.dts:      model = "Alt";
arch/arm/boot/dts/sh73a0-kzm9g.dts:     model = "KZM-A9-GT";

ePAPR says:

"The recommended format is: “manufacturer,model”, where manufacturer is a
 string describing the name of the manufacturer (such as a stock ticker symbol),
 and model specifies the model number.

 Example:
         model = “fsl,MPC8349EMITX”;"

In personal conversations with technical people, I call myself a hacker. But
when I'm talking to journalists I just say "programmer" or something like that.
