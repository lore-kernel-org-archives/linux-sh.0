Ah, ok -- you're suggesting bringing it _all_ in through arm-soc. We
can do so, I was of the initial impression from Simon's cover letter
that the arch/sh branches would also go through the SH tree.

This seems to be a particularly hairy conversion, given that it touches two
architectures that need to be updated in lockstep. I guess we might be just as
well off pulling it in as-is (with below exceptions) to get it in.

If you need the same contents in the SH tree due to dependencies and
later development, let me know and we can agree on a stable branch that
we both pick up in either tree that has all contents.

Simon, based on the above, would you mind splitting off the non-pinctrl updates
to separate branches?

I'll likely pick this up as a standalone branch, and not try to fit it into the
usual arm-soc categories, so feel free to use the pinctrl branch contents as
a base for the other branches if you have to, but maybe you can avoid it
alltogether if there aren't any substantial conflicts between the pinctrl
restructuring and the other patches mentioned above.
