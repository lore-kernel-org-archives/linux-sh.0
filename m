Yes, the diff is, unfortunately, pretty large. But so far I don't see a 
good way to split it. Essentially this patch introduces two changes:

1. asynchronous request processing
2. threaded IRQ

but, I don't think, splitting these changes would make sense. You don't 
want to implement (1) by another means, other than (2), because that'd be 
a double work. And if you already do (2) - you practically arrive at (1) 
too.

I'm not that much rewriting the driver either - most low-level functions 
are preserved, but many of them have to be rearranged. E.g., functions to 
process specific requests - single block read / write, multiple block r/w, 
etc., are split into to - the part before going to sleep, and the part 
after the hardware interrupt, which is now called from the IRQ thread. But 
the diff cannot show that as moved code, so, it looks huge.

But I'll spend some more time, thinking about possibilities to split or 
reduce the diff, maybe I get an idea...

Ok, I'll try to add some documentation to the next version of the patch.

Thanks
