Right. I assumed previous SoC (Gen2) were using MMC_CAP_WAIT_WHILE_BUSY
already, so this step would then have to be taken seperately to catch
all SoC. But I was wrong.

I meanwhile found the timeout bits which are present in Gen3 and also in
Gen2 and are currently unused by the driver. While this helps explaining
that the HW has internal busy detection, its full potential is not
implemented yet.

So, I am going to resend patch 9 without MMC_CAP_WAIT_WHILE_BUSY set and
will implement timeout handling incrementally as a seperate series.

Sounds good?
