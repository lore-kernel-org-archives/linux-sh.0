sh_dmae_ctl_stop() stops the DMA engine, not the clock.
Accessing the DMA engine cannot be done while the module clock is stopped.

If pm_runtime_suspended() returns true, I can indeed just return (no new
request can come in while .shutdown() is called).
However, if pm_runtime_suspended() returns false, the device may still
become runtime suspended in between the check for pm_runtime_suspended()
and accessing the DMA engine registers in sh_dmae_ctl_stop(), as runtime
suspend is an asynchronous operation, right?

So I think adding a check for pm_runtime_suspended() can only serve as
an optimization, the pm_runtime_{get_sync,put}() has to stay to prevent a
race condition.

Please correct me if I'm wrong.

Thanks!

Gr{oetje,eeting}s,
