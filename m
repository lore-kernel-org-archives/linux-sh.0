Yes, they don't fit into the model. They have been a dumb hack from the
first day, and never integrated into the kenrel driver core or hotplug
properly.

If you need the userspace visibility, better just add a "struct
bus_type" with a proper name for your subsystem and register a "struct
device" with the bus_type assigned for all of them, instead of using the
broken concept of sydevs. You can even make them show up
in /sys/devices/system/<bus_type name>/<struct device name>/ if you want
to.

That way userspace can properly enumerate them in a flat list
in /sys/bus/<bus_type name>/devices/*, and gets proper events on module
load and during system coldplug, and can hook into the usual hotplug
pathes to set/get these values instead of crawling magicly defined and
decoupled locations in /sys which can not express proper hierarchy,
classicication, or anything else that all other devices can just do.

There is really no reason for any device being a magic and conceptually
broken sysdev today - just to be different from any other device the
kernel exports to userspace.

Thanks,
