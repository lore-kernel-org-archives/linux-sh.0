Ok, thanks, I will!

Yes, I agree. I will fix.

Thanks, I will look into this and sync with the r8a7790 PFC table if needed!

Thanks for checking the VIN bits. I believe your comments are all
valid, and I propose that I simply remove the VIN portions and request
people to address your commends and submit support for this
independently. I hope that is OK with you.

Ok, I will fix that.

If you don't mind then I will address the minor things myself and drop
the VIN portion and then resend it as V2.

Thanks for your review!
