I'm confused. If a clock's rate can't be changed and it can't be enabled 
or disabled, then what's the point of representing that clock 
signal/line as a clock in the driver. Seems like a "nothing to see here, 
move along" type of clock. To express it differently, I find this 
similar to "if (1) { ... }". Obviously I'm missing something here. What 
is it?
