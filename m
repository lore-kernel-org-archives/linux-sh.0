I realise that this is the approach that has been taken previously by this
driver for some other SoCs but it is inconsistent with the approach that
has (recently) emerged for drivers for Renesas IP.

The problem with this approach is that although the hardware may appear to
be the same in the absence of some kind of version number for the IP we
can't be certain it is the same.  Some difference may come to light later
and then this system breaks down.

Sure, at that point we can create a more fine-grained compatibility string.
But the approach that has emerged is that in the absence of a clearly
documented version number for the hardware the SoC name is used as the
version number.

I am also not entirely happy with the approach taken by this patch for
two other reasons:

1) It removes rather than deprecating an existing compatibility string.
   Albeit one that may not actually be used in the wild.

2) It changes both drivers/net/ and arch/arm/mach-shmobile/ code.
   This kind of cross-subsystem change can lead to conflicts which
   make Linus grumpy: this has occurred recently with shmobile code
   though not in this driver.

That said, I did successfully test this patch in conjunction with
companion patches for the r8A7791 SoC and Koelsch board.
