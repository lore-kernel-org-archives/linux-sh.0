Hm, AFAIK WC memory is not compatible with the spinlocks/mutexs/etc in
Linux, so while it is true the memory has no side effects, there would
be surprising concurrency risks if anything in the kernel tried to
write to it.

Not compatible means the locks don't contain stores to WC memory the
way you would expect. AFAIK on many CPUs extra barriers are required
to keep WC stores ordered, the same way ARM already has extra barriers
to keep UC stores ordered with locking..

The spinlocks are defined to contain UC stores though.

If there is no actual need today for WC I would suggest using UC as
the default.
