This has been shifted by 1 byte..

That looks odd, it should be the number of dwords in the
interrupt-map, you have 4 lines of 8 dwords each, so it should be
32. 

You have 7*4, which really suggests to me that your interrupt-map
is corrupted somehow, are you sure you are using this:

If an element was missing it would explain why everything is broken,
in fact if GIC_SPI was missing it would match the debug perfectly.

K..

And it is the wrong data.. 123/4/0 is

Well, since we know the map is corrupted somehow, it isn't surprising
that the 2nd entry won't match anything. It is probably matching
against '0 0 2 &intc'
