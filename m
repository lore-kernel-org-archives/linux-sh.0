Hi Olof, Hi Kevin, Hi Arnd,

Please consider these third round of Renesas ARM based soc updates for v3.19.

This pull request is based on the previous round of
such requests, tagged as renesas-soc2-for-v3.19,
which I have already sent a pull-request for.

This pull request is based on the previous round of
such requests, tagged as renesas-soc2-for-v3.19,

Please note that "ARM: shmobile: always build rcar setup for armv7"
corrects a build failure in allmodconfig caused by "ARM: shmobile:
rcar-gen2: Add CA7 arch_timer initialization for r8a7794" which
is included in the first round of Renesas ARM Based SoC Soc Updates for
v3.19, tagged as renesas-soc2-for-v3.19, which I have previously sent
a pull-request for.

To be clear, this pull request is based on renesas-soc2-for-v3.19 which
is in turn based on renesas-soc2-for-v3.19.
