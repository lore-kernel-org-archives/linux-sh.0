Ouch, sorry! I checked the patches and somehow I missed a chunk in
0007-... when I rebased the series to next. The part that actually
adds the DT info to r8a7740.dtsi. Further we need the GIC to be
present in the DT to make things work here (my old patch used the
INTCA as interrupt controller reference, but that has gone in the
meantime).
I want to repost my A1 reference code soon and in there I add the way
to set up the GIC via DT.

To accelerate things maybe we take 0001-0006 now and postpone 0007
until the GIC is in the DT?
I diffed the new patches against the v3 series, and the .dtsi chunk is
the only one that didn't make it, so I strongly believe the series is
fine now.

Thanks,

 Bastian
