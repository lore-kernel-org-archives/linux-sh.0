I do understand that the situation is mutually exclusive currently,
and even after the gpio patches. I'm probably just being overly-cautious here.

There have been a couple of situations where a DT configuration was invalid
and some ugly hoops were required to prevent it in the driver; eg., famously
the OMAP dma fubar.

I guess I'd be okay with skipping it as long as I knew someone was going to
make sure it got addressed soonish.

Sorry, no, I didn't mean the driver should try to implement some polling
scheme on its own.

For autoCTS when the driver/hardware does not have CTS interrupt support,
set UPSTAT_AUTOCTS in port->status. This will prevent the serial core from
stopping the tty if CTS is not active (since the driver/hardware cannot
restart the tty when CTS is set active).

For !autoCTS when the driver/hardware does not have CTS interrupt support,
get_mctrl() must always report CTS active. [Another potential solution is
to disable CRTSCTS in the driver's set_termios method: this would be
preferable but I'm not sure all userspace will be ok with this.]

Yes, but I consider that a refinement over basic CTS/RTS handling, and
so not an actual driver requirement.

Well, a driver can only support s/w assisted h/w flow control*, even though
the h/w is capable of autoCTS.

* enabling/disabling tx on dCTS interrupt

This looks broken.

If CRTSCTS is set and CTS is pinned to a gpio, tx will continue even when
the CTS gpio is inactive.

Also, if the CTS gpio is inactive when the tty is opened or the termios is
changed, tx will be stuck off.


> it doesn't poll CTS, but always sets TIOCM_CTS, probably to work around this?

This driver is not always setting TIOCM_CTS; that's just the default if CTS
is not pinned to a gpio.

Yes.


> Now, why would you want to override RTS output,

A couple of reasons:

1. userspace terminal control will expect to be able to use
   TIOCMSET/TIOCMBIC/TIOCMBIS to stop/resume input by dropping RTS when
   using CRTSCTS.
2. userspace drivers for uart-interfaced devices use TIOCMSET on RTS for things
   like device wakeup.
3. in-tree drivers use tiocmset() directly for the same thing.


> and is [*] above an issue?

Yes. The driver must disable autoRTS in set_mctrl() if TIOCM_RTS is clear and
restore the autoRTS/RTS state if TIOCM_RTS is set.
The omap8250 driver does this (omap8250_set_mctrl()).

IMPORTANT NOTE: do _not_ use UPSTAT_AUTORTS to track your autoRTS state, like
the omap8250 driver does.

If you do, you need to provide throttle/unthrottle methods to stop and resume
remote input; however, I don't think the methods currently used by these
drivers is appropriate or safe (by letting the rx fifo fill up).

No, but that does happen.

Not your fault. I should really document this.
