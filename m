Yes, thanks. I've to learn and remember this, too :)

Yes, the A57 PMU probe is successful.

What's not working with the latest Renesas BSP is the A53, because these 
cores are disabled in the firmware coming with that BSP. But that's not 
a PMU issue, it's just because the cores are disabled. Using an older 
BSP firmware enabling all cores makes the A53 PMU probe fine, too.

Best regards
