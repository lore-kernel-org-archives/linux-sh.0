This series moves the r7s72100 platfrom from the legacy clock implementation to
the common clock framework.

This series has been tested with the renesas-devel-v3.14-rc5-20140307v2 tag.
If you want to boot into a console, you have a runtime dependency [1].

Patches 1-5 is the minimal set to activate CCF and get the board booting into a
console. Patches 6-8 add SCIF support, 9+10 I2C support, and 11+12 SPI support.

Changes since V2:

Patches 1+3 got updates, patch 12 was not send out last time due to sendmail error.

Patch 1 should probably go via clock tree (it has no dependencies). The rest
via shmobile. Please apply.

PS: A tree can be found here with this series only:

And here with a quick hack to make the system bootable:
