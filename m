Hm, sorry for being unclear - I should have used the words "other
initcall levels depending on the init order of the parent hardware
bus". I'm referring to the state of things now without any patches
from Grant.

I understand that early init code often are using different initcall
levels to make sure they are getting initialized before other code.
Initcalls can also be used to work around link order issues.

I can't however see the reason why a keypad driver needs to be
initialized early on. I may be wrong, but I thought user space was the
only consumer of input devices?
