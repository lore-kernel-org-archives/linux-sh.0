Hi Steve,

I apologise for not noticing this earlier:
I am entirely unsure how I missed it.

In principle I am fine with this change so long as it does not
introduce any backwards-compatibility problems. In particular removing
compatibility strings that may already be in use by DTB blobs in the wild.

For SH Mobile it seems that Lager and Koelsch were using "diasemi,da9210"
which is unsupported by the driver at this time. So it seems there is no
backwards-compatibility problem there. I'm less sure about other aspects of
the patch. And I'm also less concerned about them.

I do have a slight preference for SH Mobile changes to go through my
renesas tree rather than elsewhere (as part of a more global change)
principally to try to avoid the possibility of conflicts. The SH Mobile dts
files in question are often updated. And for example I notice some fuzz
when applying this patch on top of the next-20140729 tag of linux-next.

If you were to break out the SH Mobile portion of this patch I would be
happy to take it once the driver portion is accepted.  That said, I do see
that everyone else has acked the change so clearly this is not an issue
from their point of view. So I will not complain if you decide not to break
the patch up (though please note my warning about possible conflicts).

In the case where you do not want to split up the patch:
