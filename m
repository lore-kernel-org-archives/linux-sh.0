In arch/arm/Kconfig, there is already a
config ARCH_SHMOBILE_LEGACY
	bool "Renesas ARM SoCs (non-multiplatform)"
	select ARCH_SHMOBILE

But, that will only get you to a limited number of systems to choose from.


The system I want (ARCH_R7S72100), in arch/arm/mach-shmobile/Kconfig is buried inside
if ARCH_SHMOBILE_MULTI
. . .
. . .
config ARCH_R7S72100
	bool "RZ/A1H (R7S72100)"
	select SYS_SUPPORTS_SH_MTU2
. . .
. . .
endif


Hence, I can't select ARCH_R7S72100 without first selecting multi-platform.

So, to not break multi-platform, but still allow single builds (and not
break anyone's existing config files), we'd have to go back to the way
it was, which was having duplicate ARCH entries in:

if ARCH_SHMOBILE_MULTI
. . .
. . .
endif

 and

if ARCH_SHMOBILE_LEGACY
. . .
. . .
endif

However, this idea conflicts with Arnd's statement:

I must be missing something, but the only way to have it show up in the menu under multi-platform and single-platform is to duplicate the ARCH_xxx entry.
