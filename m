Hi Kevin, Hi Olof, Hi Arnd,

please consider this third round of Renesas ARM based SoC updates for v3.12.

It is based on renesas-soc-for-v3.12 ("Second Round of ARM based SoC
updates for v3.12") which you have previously pulled.

I apologise that this and other pull requests that I will send today
are rather later in the cycle than I would like. This is primarily due
to a combination of my summer vacation and wanting to let the patches
sit in next for a while.
