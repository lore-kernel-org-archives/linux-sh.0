ARM: shmobile: EMEV2 and KZM9D update

[PATCH 01/08] ARM: shmobile: Remove unused EMEV2/KZM9D early console
[PATCH 02/08] ARM: shmobile: Update KZM9D dts command line
[PATCH 03/08] ARM: shmobile: Make EMEV2 platform devices more compact
[PATCH 04/08] ARM: shmobile: Add GIO to EMEV2 dtsi
[PATCH 05/08] ARM: shmobile: Use DT for GIC on EMEV2 and KZM9D
[PATCH 06/08] ARM: shmobile: Use DT for SMP on EMEV2 and KZM9D
[PATCH 07/08] ARM: shmobile: EMEV2 map_io update
[PATCH 08/08] ARM: shmobile: Disconnect EMEV2 SMP code from clocks

Several minor updates for the EMEV2 SoC and the KZM9D board:
- Get rid of early console - the 8250-em driver does not support it
- Update command line in DTS and remove old cruft
- Make the EMEV2 platform devices more compact
- Add GIO device nodes to the EMEV2 dtsi
- Use DT for GIC and SMP for both regular KZM9D board code and DT
- Reduce the size of the EMEV2 map_io - SCU is still however needed
- Allow EMEV2 SMP to operate without legacy clock bits
