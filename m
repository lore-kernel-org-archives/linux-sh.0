Hi Olof, Hi Kevin, Hi Arnd,

Please consider these second round of Renesas ARM based SoC fixes for v3.16.

The first round of fixes was prior to the release of v3.16-rc1 so
this pull-request is based on v3.16-rc1.

I would like this change considered for v3.15-stable.
I can handle submitting it there if you like.

I do not think it is necessary to consider it for v3.14-stable
as although the incorrect code is present there it is not exercised
in that release.


The following changes since commit 7171511eaec5bf23fb06078f59784a3a0626b38f:

  ARM: shmobile: r8a7791: Fix SD2CKCR register address (2014-07-23 08:55:12 +0900)

----------------------------------------------------------------
Second Round of Renesas ARM Based SoC Fixes for v3.16

* Fix SD2CKCR register address of r8a7791 (R-Car M2) SoC

  This corrects a bug introduced in v3.14 by
  59e79895b9589286 ("ARM: shmobile: r8a7791: Add clocks").

  However, it does not manifest in mainline code until
  SDHI devices were enabled on the Koelsch board in v3.15 by
  2c60a7df72711fb8 ("ARM: shmobile: Add SDHI devices for Koelsch DTS").

  It also manifests on the Henninger board when
  SDHI devices were enabled in v3.16-rc1 by
  1299df03d7191ab4 ("ARM: shmobile: henninger: add SDHI0/2 DT support")
