	Hi,

This patch series adds DT DMA support to the Renesas "SCI" serial driver
on R-Car Gen2 SoCs.
It depends on "[PATCH v3 00/33] serial: sh-sci: Miscellaneous
and DMA Improvements", which contains preparatory patches that are
considered stable.

Some of these patches have been sent before, cfr.
  - [PATCH/RFC v2 00/29] serial: sh-sci: Miscellaneous and DMA
    Improvements (http://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-sh/msg43567.html)
  - [PATCH/RFC 0/8] serial: sh-sci: Add DT DMA support
    (http://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-sh/msg42258.html)

Major change is the replacement of the one-byte DMA transfer on (H)SCIF
by submitting receive DMA requests from the receive interrupt handler.

This was tested on r8a7791/koelsch, using SCIF, SCIFA, SCIFB, and HSCIF.
It should work with and without CONFIG_HIGHMEM (thanks to Shimoda-san).
There are still some known issues in case of overrun errors.

For your convenience, I've also pushed this to
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/geert/renesas-drivers.git#scif-dma-v3

While it doesn't seem to be a hard requirement, I included the fixed
version of "dmaengine: rcar-dmac: Fix residue reporting for pending
descriptors".

Note that SCI DMA support was originally written for SH-based systems,
and was never fully wired up in platform code in mainline, so the risk
for regressions is fairly small.

Thanks for your comments!
