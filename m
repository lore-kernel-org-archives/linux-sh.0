I would say that the earlier comments "a real hardware device is required
for a node to be present in DT" still stands and so this patch doesn't
introduce anything new.

@Rob: What do you think about getting a DT node for probing cpufreq
driver? We surely need some way without declaring a platform device
to get driver probed..

Or if we can put this information in the cpu node, which we don't have
to replicate in all cpus..
