Hi Sergei,

Thanks for your patch.

Quick question: Does this pin description match to the board layout? I
suspect that clock and data by themselves are not enough.

I'm not sure about Koelsch, but  in case of older SoCs using the CEU
there were signals used like horizontal and vertical sync and
sometimes even something that was used to determine interlace.

Thanks,
