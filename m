Hi again Russell,

Will you pick up this one in your tree as-is, or would you like me to
resubmit it somehow?

Perhaps you prefer that we take it with the other changes through the
genesis-2.6 tree?

Sorry to bother you if this has already been sorted. I just noticed
that the patch isn't part of the latest linux-next.

Thanks,

/ magnus
