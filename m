I suspect arch/sh is in a similar state to what arch/arm was in when we added
arch/arm64, where 90% of the code is there to deal with concepts that no longer
apply to the new code base, in particular board support for pre-DT machines.

Starting a new arch/j64 would then make it look more like a clean arch/riscv/ or
arch/nds32, which are the most recently added ones. However, if you do
that, you should really start from scratch instead of copying the existing
arch code, which was the mistake that arch/arm64 did.
