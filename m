I can verify it fails on PPC as well:

drivers/staging/comedi/drivers.c: In function 'comedi_buf_alloc':
drivers/staging/comedi/drivers.c:505:37: error: 'PAGE_KERNEL_NOCACHE' undec=
lared (first use in this function)
drivers/staging/comedi/drivers.c:505:37: note: each undeclared identifier i=
s reported only once for each function it appears in

However, we do have a #define for PAGE_KERNEL_NC.
