Hi Laurent,

Thanks for your comments.

Yes, looking again at the spec, your values are the correct ones.

No, not really. The PMB will only remap physical addresses, not virtual 
addresses.  Moreover, the remapped address is only accessible from the 
IP blocks which are on the ICB bus, not the CPU.  I will update the 
comment to mention this.  These IP blocks already have access to the 
entire physical memory address space, so I don't think that adding the 
the PMB into mix introduces any new security issues.

Yes it does.

Thanks for your other comments too.  I'll look into making those changes.
