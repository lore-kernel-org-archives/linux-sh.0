I just wanted to clarify here.  Is your comment about these new flags in 
specific reference to this patch or to Magnus' "going forward" comment? 
  It seems like the beginnings of a method to standardize YCbCr support 
in fbdev across all platforms.
Also, do I understand correctly that FB_VISUAL_ would specify the 
colorspace (RGB, YCbCr), FB_TYPE_* would be a format specifier (i.e. 
planar, semiplanar, interleaved, etc)?  I'm not really sure what you are 
referring to with the FB_AUX_* however.
