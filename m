+SH7760 integrated LCDC Framebuffer driver
+====================+
+0. Overwiew
+-----------
+The SH7760/SH7763 have an integrated LCD Display controller (LCDC) which
+supports (in theory) resolutions ranging from 1x1 to 1024x1024,
+with color depths ranging from 1 to 16 bit.
+Supports STN, DSTN and TFT Panels.
+
+* Framebuffer memory must be a large chunk allocated at the top
+  of Area3 (HW requirement). Because of this requirement you should NOT
+  make the driver a module since at runtime it may become impossible to
+  get a large enough contiguous chunk of memory.
+
+* The driver does not support changing resolution while loaded
+  (LCD's aren't hotpluggable anyway)
+
+* Heavy flickering may be observed
+  a) if you're using 15/16bit color modes at >= 640x480 px resolutions,
+  b) during PCMCIA (or any other slow bus) activity.
+
+* Rotation works only 90degress clockwise, and only if horizontal
+  resolution is <= 320 pixels.

+
+1. Platform setup
+-----------------
+Video data is fetched via the DMABRG DMA engine, so you have to
+configure the SH DMAC for DMABRG mode (write 0x94808080 to the
+DMARSRA register somewhere at boot).
+
+PFC registers PCCR and PCDR must be set to peripheral mode.
+(write zeros to both).
+
+The driver does NOT do the above for you (since board setup is, well, job
+of the board setup code).
+
+2. Panel definitions
+--------------------
+The LCDC must explicitly be told about the type of LCD panel
+attached. Data must be wrapped in a "struct sh7760fb_platdata" and
+passed to the driver as platform_data.
+
+Suggest you take a closer look at the SH7760 Manual, Section 30.

+The following code illustrates what needs to be done to
+get the framebuffer working on a 640x480 TFT:
