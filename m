Because that is what the PCI bus binding standard says to do, and
new drivers have been pushed toward conforming to that document.

I'm not sure if "pciex" was ever standardized, I haven't see a spec
that reflects that at least.

Commit 14e2abb732e485ee57d9d5b2cb8884652238e5c1 introduced support for
the "pciex" word, but it looks driven by proprietary choices by IBM..

In any event there isn't a single 'device_type = "pciex";' pre-exsting
in the kernel bindings today, so please don't add one :)

Regards,
Jason
