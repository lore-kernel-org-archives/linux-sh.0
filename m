Hi Russell,

please considder pulling
  git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/horms/shmobile-2.6.git for-russell

To get the following changes since commit 0ce790e7d736cedc563e1fb4e998babf5a4dbc3d:

  Linux 2.6.39-rc1 (2011-03-29 12:09:47 -0700)

I apologised for not sending this earlier, however the last
dependency for this patch only went in just before 2.6.39-rc1 -
the 2nd last patch of the last merge.

I believe that the potential fall out of this patch is
limited to breaking (non-eSD) zboot support for SuperH Mobile ARM
and as such I would like it considered for inclusion in 2.6.39-rc2.
