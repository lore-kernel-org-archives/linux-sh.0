I appreciate that...

... my concern is that the data we place into the DT will be untested
given that we don't have software relying on it. If said data is not
correct, it is harmful to have, especially for such fundamental
properties.

This is unfortunate.

Who put the DT together in the first place?

If it's a multi-cluster SoC then we know that we're not using any
built-in distributor...

Potentially for such implementations, yes. To the best of my knowledge a
GIC-400 is a single block, which is one reason why it would be nice to
focus on that particular implementation if that's applicable.

That worries me somewhat, given my comments above, though I'd very much
suspect this is a GIC-400.

I'm going by the TRM. There are other items not in the bindign that are
implementation-specific.

Could you elborate on that? I don't see why a node's clock-names
property should be relevant to the clock controller.

That's irrelevant from the PoV of the GIC; per the GIC architecture you
can't assume anything about the set of input clocks, and GIC-400 happens
to have a single clock input called "CLK". It's not IP specific to
Renesas.

Sorry, I don't follow this last part.

Mark.
