You don't have to send in a big initial patch that actually boots.
For new architecture/SoC/board support, just split it in logical hunks,
and submit it in some logical order that always builds.

E.g.:
  - SoC core support (arch/sh/),
  - Board support (arch/sh/),
  - Drivers.

The first two should go in through akpm (sh is orphaned),
the rest through the individual subsystem maintainers.

Sh is an existing supported architecture, so DT is not a hard requirement.
If you would have waited until after the removal of sh, it would be much
harder :-) (cfr. h8300, but Sato-san did a great job there, with DT, CCF, ...)

It's great to hear there's so much interest in this! Let's hope this will
attract more actual contributors...
