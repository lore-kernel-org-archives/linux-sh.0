OK, I see.

But I did send my ack in the beginning of Nov on cover [0/7] like
following...
http://lists.infradead.org/pipermail/linux-arm-kernel/2011-November/071800.h
tml

So I didn't send my ack on this...

As a note, I'm sorting out header files, local headers in Samsung stuff as

Anyway, thanks.

Best regards,
Kgene.
