Subject: [PATCH v4 00/19]  ARM: shmobile: r8a7779, marzen: CCF and multiplatform

The aim of this series is to add common clock framework and in turn
multiplatform support to the r8a7779 SoC and marzen-reference.  It
subsequently removes non-multiplatform support from marzen-reference.

This is based on work for R-Car Gen2 by Laurent Pinchart and Magnus Damm.


This series is based on the renesas-devel-v3.14-rc6-20140313v3
tag of my renesas tree.

This series requires "spi: sh-hspi: Do not specifically request shyway_clk"
in order for HSPI to be initialised when booting using multiplatform.

This series is known not to work when
booting with SMP enabled and maxcpus not set to 1.

This series attempts to address the extensive review
received for v3 of this series. Changes are noted
in the changelog of individual patches.
