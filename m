One case where it would perhaps make sense if you define some fields
with shifts and masks. Specifying shifts as decimal and masks as hex
is clearer IMO. But in this case I agree it just looks ugly and only
serves to confuse the reader as he tries to figure out if there's
some magic meaning to the different formats.

I find enums easier on the eye than defines. Less irrelevant junk on
each line. There's no reason you can't pass enum values as u8. But in
that case giving the enum a name doesn't really make sense.
