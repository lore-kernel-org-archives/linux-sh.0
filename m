Hi Olof,

the DT exists but currently the marzen board brings up all
of its devices using platform devices. Which if nothing else is
internally consistent.

I suppose it would be possible to add a call to
r8a7779_add_standard_devices_dt() and have the board bring
up this device using DT and the rest using platform drivers
(until the drivers are migrated to DT).

Would that be your preferred option?

Magnus, how do you feel about this idea?
