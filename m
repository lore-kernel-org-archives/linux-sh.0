	Hi all,

This RFC patch series adds board staging support for r8a7740/armadillo.
For now this supports only the frame buffer device for the on-board LCD.
The goal is to complete the move to ARM multiplatform kernels for all
shmobile platforms, and drop the existing board files
(arch/arm/mach-shmobile/board-*).

The board staging area was introduced last year to allow continuous
upstream in-tree development and integration of platform devices. It
helps developers integrate devices as platform devices for device
drivers that only provide platform device bindings.  This in turn allows
for incremental development of both hardware feature support and DT
binding work in parallel.

This series consists of 4 parts:
  - Patch 1 re-enables compilation of the board staging area, which was
    disabled after a compile breakage, but has been fixed in the mean
    time,
  - Path 2 moves initialization of staging board code to an earlier
    moment, as currently it happens after unused PM domains are powered
    down,
  - Patches 3 and 4 (hopefully) fix the existing kzm9d board staging
    code, which was presumably broken by commit 9a1091ef0017c40a
    ("irqchip: gic: Support hierarchy irq domain."),
  - Patches 5 and 6 add support for registering platform devices with
    complex dependencies (clocks, pinctrl, gpios, PM domains), and add
    armadillo board staging code for enabling a frame buffer on the
    on-board LCD.

Questions:
  - Are there other devices from board-armadillo.c that work fine in
    armadillo-legacy, and that we want to add?
    I think this is the list of devices lacking DT support and/or
    missing in DTS:
      - renesas_usbhs (does this work? the platform device is
	instantiated conditionally, but the condition (gpio state) is
	never true?)
      - sh-mobile-hdmi/sh_mobile_lcdc_fb.1 (this seems to be broken in
	-legacy?)
      - sdhi1 (we do have sdhi0)
      - mmcif
      - soc-camera-pdrv/sh_mobile_ceu
      - ipmmu
      - sh-dma-engine (this will probably never get DT support)

  - What about support for other boards (kzm9g, bockw, marzen)?

This was tested on r8a7740/armadillo.
This was not tested on emev2/kzm9d, due to lack of hardware.

Thanks for your comments!
