The clock assignments are not specific to Lager so they probably belong
in r8a7790.dtsi; the dividers are configurable and could be
board-specific.

The board design could conceivably limit the usable frequency to below
the chip's maximum, though presumably that won't usually happen.
Currently the clk-rcar-gen2 driver only configures the dividers for
sdhi{0,1}.  That leaves the rest of them effectively controlled by the
board's firmware.
