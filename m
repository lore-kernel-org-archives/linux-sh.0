This is why I have not checked for such cases - I have skipped checks of type
	unsigned <= 0
exactly for the reasons above.

However I have left two other checks as they seems to me more suspicious - they
are always true or false. But as Dmitry and Andrew pointed out Linus have quite
strong opinion against removing range checks in such cases as he finds it
clearer. I think it applies to patches 29-36. I am not sure about patches 26-28,37.
