Adding it without anyone using it doesn't solve anything.  We need
people to commit to producing patches to use it for the next merge
window.

And if you think its not about lines of code - grab the current linux-next
tree and look at the diff between v2.6.39-rc1 and master for arch/arm, and
then tell me whether using LOC is unreasonable given the patch content.
