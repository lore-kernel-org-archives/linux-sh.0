The issue you're facing is that ARCH_MULTIPLATFORM actually means two things:
  1. Use modern infrastructure (e.g. DT, CCF, GPIOLIB, ...) instead of board
     files with platform devices,
  2. Allow to build a single kernel that supports multiple SoC families and/or
     boards.

The first thing is not incompatible with XIP_KERNEL (AFAIK), the second is
(or rather, may be?).

Perhaps ARCH_MULTIPLATFORM should be replaced by ARCH_ARM_NEWWORLD
almost everywhere, and (new) ARCH_MULTIPLATFORM should be reserved
(if needed at all) to protect features that are not compatible with running on
multiple machines?

Besides, I think a multi-platform XIP (or nommu) kernel is possible, as long
as XIP_PHYS_ADDR (or PHYS_OFFSET) is suitable for all platforms included.

Gr{oetje,eeting}s,

                        Geert
