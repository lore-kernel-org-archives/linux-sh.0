I gave this a spin atop of v4.14-rc3 with a few arm64 toolchains I had
installed:

* Linaro 17.08 GCC 7.1    // strong
* Linaro 17.05 GCC 6.1    // strong
* Linaro 15.08 GCC 5.1    // strong
* Linaro 14.09 GCC 4.9    // strong
* Linaro 13.06 GCC 4.8    // none
* Linaro 13.01 GCC 4.7    // none

AFAICT, the detection is correct, and arm64 toolchains only gained stack
protector support in GCC 4.9. I manually tested GCC 4.8 and 4.7, and
got:

  warning: -fstack-protector not supported for this target [enabled by default]

... so that looks good to me.

One thing I noticed was taht even when the build system detects no
support for stack-protector, it still passes -DCONFIG_CC_STACKPROTECTOR
to the toolchain. Is that expected?

Thanks,
Mark.
