Hi Vinod

Sorry, originally the 2 patches from this thread only touched files under 
mmc and ARM, so, you were not CCed, but eventually this turned into a 
dmaengine API discussion, so, I'm adding you to CC and asking about your 
opinion.

And what happens then? How do those parameters get used by the stedma40 
driver to configure the hardware? I see, in its filter function the 
stedma40 driver is storing the configuration in the driver private channel 
struct for later use. SHDMA used to do the same (ok, we used the .private 
pointer for that, but essentially it was the same), but we were told to 
stop doing that. The filter function should only verify, whether a channel 
is suitable, and not set any configuration. That's what the 
dmaengine_slave_config() function is for, including the .slave_id 
parameter in struct dma_slave_config.

As explained in an earlier email, my opinion is, that my simple header 
patch is a corrent fix for the currently present build failure. As for 
this discussion, what is your opinion on this? Is the new use of the 
.slave_id field in struct dma_slave_config correct in the driver and its 
users or not?
