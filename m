Indeed, good idea! This API is (unfortunately) so rarely used, that it was  
pretty much completely absent from my "active dictionary."

I don't care about names all that much either, but as Simon suggested in 
his other mail, consistency is good. Besides, yes, I thought about "data"
as a name for the main SDHI IRQ, but I decided it didn't reflect its 
function very well. Firstly, it is not only data, secondly, SDIO IRQs can 
also announce data availability, I think. The even more precise 
description of these two IRQs would be, perhaps, "synchronous" and 
"asynchronous," but that's probably not very intuitivy.

So, I'll accept any names, that you two agree upon:-)
