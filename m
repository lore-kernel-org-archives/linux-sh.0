Per the above comments, the renesas drivers were a no-op and and got
Ack:  from appropriate people hence why I forked them out of the earlier
bigger series, in thinking they were OK'd and done as-is.

That said, if "be modular, or die trying" is the desired approach for
PCI code, I can do my best to work within that constraint.  It just
won't be the no-op 1:1 mapping that the original proposed changes were.
