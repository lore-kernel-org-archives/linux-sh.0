I've spent 30 minutes looking through your submission to find something
wrong with it now, but it all looks fine, the only criticism would be that
some of the changelogs could provide a little more background.

The original implementation seems odd in some places, but your
new version resolves the few concerns I had (like mixing up
phys and dma addresses), and I didn't see anything that should
change behavior.

I hope that helps.
