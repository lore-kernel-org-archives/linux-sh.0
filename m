Stirring the pot again...

Which clocks a device needs is expressed in DT with CCF.
In the simple case, the runtime PM core can just control them based on
device use.
In the complex case, the driver can regain control using its own pm
callbacks, right?

Probably I'm still missing something, as I haven't had enough exposure to
runtime PM and CCF ;-)
