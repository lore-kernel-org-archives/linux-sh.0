Note that CONFIG_OF is also set for ARM-legacy (and soon for SH). But that's
a minor problem. But due to the runtime check on pfc->dev->of_node, the
unused code below won't be left out by the compiler, and I want to get rid
of that code.

The platform check make it clear when the code can be removed.

Early return is indeed an option, as we don't need the function GPIOs on
DT platforms.
