We should either fix /dev/mem to work according to its specification or
rip it out.  The issue with test drivers is not spurious... I ran into
this one myself a few weeks ago while trying to do a memory test (by
limiting the amount of memory available to the kernel).  This is
something that is typically done on factory floors, and it would be nice
to be able to get those environments over to using Linux.
