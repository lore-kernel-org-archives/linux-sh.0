I don't think that this is where we should fix it.  At least using
timekeeping_suspended outside of the timekeeping core would not be
welcome by its maintainers.

The problem seems to be that the clock domain is powered on in a
syscore resume routine which happens to be called before timekeeping_resume().
It looks like we either need to force the right ordering somehow or have a
special variant of GENPD_DEV_TIMED_CALLBACK() for syscore suspend/resume that
won't do the latency measurement at all (which doesn't make much sense at
this point, because time is effectively "frozen" then).
