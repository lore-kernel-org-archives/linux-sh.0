Rob, Grant, do either of you know if there's a reason for this that we've
missed?

The gic doesn't have any direct children, and this doesn't seem to be
some decvicetree interrupt-controller magic.

If this is superfluous, how about the patch below?

I took a quick look at arch/arm/boot/dts/. Some gic nodes don't have
#address-cells, some have it but not #size-cells, and some have both. These
should probably be cleaned up too.

[...]

Thanks,
Mark.

Subject: [PATCH] Docs: gic: remove #address-cells from example

The gic has no child nodes, and so doesn't need #address-cells. Having
the property defined in the example only serves as a source of
confusion.
