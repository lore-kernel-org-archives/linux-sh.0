Perhaps that is the wrong link?
The code in the link seems to be the same as what is preseng
in boards-kzm9g.c already and with it in place I see the error
above if CONFIG_REGULATOR_DUMMY is not enabled.

I am testing against with next branch in the renesas tree
with the kzm9g_defconfig, less CONFIG_REGULATOR_DUMMY.
