Hi Olof, Hi Arnd,

As requested the first patch is now includes an ack from Greg
Kroah-Hartman.

This pull request is based on renesas-soc2-for-v3.11, which you have
already pulled, in order to satisfy dependencies.

The second patch in the series is provided here because it
has a build-time dependency in the first patch of the series.

The third patch of the series could be applied independently,
for instance as part of a fresh soc pull request, but it seems
just as well to include it here.
