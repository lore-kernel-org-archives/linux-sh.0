There are three compatible strings defined for the ADXL345 and ADXL346 in 
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/i2c/trivial-devices.txt: "adi,adxl345", 
"adi,adxl346", "adi,adxl34x". Given that the last one is a fallback for the 
first two I don't see a need to add the specific compatible strings to the 
driver for now. If a new totally incompatible chip named ADXL347 comes out we 
will need a new driver which won't be allowed to use the "adi,adxl34x" 
compatible string.

An option would be to remove "adi,adxl34x" from 
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/i2c/trivial-devices.txt, in which case the 
driver should match explicitly on "adi,adxl345" and "adi,adxl346". That might 
clash with the DT ABI stability requirements though.
