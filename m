Thanks for the explanation. Given this situation I wonder if we can
add the optional properties:
renesas,source-quality : The viability to use this device as a free
running clock
renesas,event-quality : Th viability to use this device as an event generator

Maybe let it run from 0-10 or from 0-255 and explain the situation in
the bindings.
I mean the environmental circumstances of the device are not really a
property of the device itself, but it doesn't need much imagination to
see it like that.

Thanks,

 Bastian
