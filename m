Ok.

So looking at the code, IIUC, SCIF does not provide a way to directly
control RTS output or read CTS input when RTS/CTS is pinned (ie, not gpio).
Is that correct?
How to support autoRTS/autoCTS depends on the answer to this question.

Is there a datasheet/trm that I can review describing register layout and
uart behavior?

yes

Not quite.

_Regardless of CRTSCTS setting_, the RTS output pin should be controlled
through .set_mctrl() method. The serial core takes CRTSCTS into account on
behalf of the driver when necessary.

yes

A couple of things.

gpio-based RTS/CTS is mutually exclusive with autoRTS/autoCTS. But I'm not
seeing any logic in these patches to prevent that.

autoCTS without a way to read CTS input level means that although transmission
stops, the driver has no way to update port->hw_stopped so the write buffer
will keep filling up until it's full @ 4k.

autoRTS without a way to override RTS output complicates throttling.
