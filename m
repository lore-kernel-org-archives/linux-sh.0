Hi Olof, Hi Kevin, Hi Arnd,

Please consider these fourth round of Renesas ARM based SoC clock
updates for v3.17.

I am sending this even though v3.16-rc6 has long since been released
as this pull-request only includes a single one line fix for a problem
introduced in patches you have already queued up for v3.16.

At it turns out the problem should not manifest at run time
as it is an error in an clock that is not used without DT modifications.
As such I am happy for you to ask me to defer this to v3.18 if you like.

This pull request is based on the previous round of
such requests, tagged as renesas-clock3-for-v3.17,
which you have already merged.
