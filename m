I will just remove that code, its was useful for development
but I didn't mean to include it in my patch submission.

Wouldn't that mean moving all of
arch/arm/boot/compressed/sdhi-shmobile.c into CPU specific code?
That could easily be achived by just guarding its compilation with
CONFIG_ARCH_SH7372 (as mmcif-sh7372.c already is) and perhaps
renaming the file to sdhi-sh7372.c. We could probably move
arch/arm/mach-shmobile/include/mach/sdhi-sh7372.h back into
sdhi-shmobile.c.

So mmc_loader() would need to take SDHI_BASE as an argument?
That sounds like a fairly small amount of refactoring.

How do you envisage that the hardware block would be selected?
At compile time through Kconfig? If so the current #define mechanism
might be sufficient.
