FWIW, Len seems to be rather inactive on the kernel mailing list right
now and generally not very interested in anything outside of x86 and
acpi. If he doesn't reply in the next few days and Andrew also isn't
interested in handling these patches, I'd suggest you just send the pull
request to Linus, with Len on Cc and explain that you tried to send
them through him but gave up in the end.
