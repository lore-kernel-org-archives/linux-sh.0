I will split the current of_pci_get_domain_nr() even further and replace it with
two functions: pci_get_domain_nr() which will do just the allocation (still based
on the boolean flag passed as parameter) and of_get_pci_domain_nr() that will
retrieve a "linux,pci-domain" value from a property belonging to a given device
node.

I plan to leave for the moment the check for mandatory presence of "linux,pci-domain"
to the host bridge driver so that everyone can implement their own policies.

How does that sound?

Best regards,
Liviu
