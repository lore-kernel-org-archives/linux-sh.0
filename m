I'm also slightly unhappy with having two different models. Of course, if I 
had thought that the two models were equally good, I would have followed yours 
:-) It seems more natural to me to express the association with an IOMMU as a 
resource, similarly to clocks, GPIOs or interrupts. It would also allow easier 
support for devices that use multiple IOMMUs (which should be pretty uncommon, 
in my case devices can have several independent bus master ports, but they all 
go through the same IOMMU, with different micro-TLBs/stream IDs).

There's no other mainline IOMMU driver that model the bus masters to IOMMU 
relationship in DT, so it's probably a good time to discuss this issue as 
broadly as possible and decide on sane rules. If we have to live with 
different models, so be it, but I think we should establish a default model at 
least for new drivers. It would especially be useful if we want to handle 
device to domain association in common code, which I believe would be a good 
target.

That's correct. The IPMMU has four domains and handles more than four devices. 
I thus need to decide to which domain to attach each device. Doing so in a 
round-robin fashion is an acceptable first implementation, but fine-tuning 
might be needed at some point for performance reasons.

Fortunately I don't need that.
