These look good to me, but I wonder what happened to the plan to reduce
the number of defconfig files we discussed before. Since you can build
a combined kernel that runs on all (or most) of the supported boards,
can you add a combined shmobile_defconfig that is able to work on
a wide variety of hardware and drop some of the less common defconfig
files?

Most of the modern platforms nowadays have just one defconfig that
covers everything.
