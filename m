That's what I was assuming, too.
But why would it work on the koelsch sister board, even with the same
kernel config?

Upon closer look, koelsch loads the DT a bit higher in memory:

## Flattened Device Tree blob at 40f00000
   Booting using the fdt blob at 0x40f00000
      Loading Device Tree to 40fed000, end 40fff5b1 ... OK

than alt:

## Flattened Device Tree blob at 40f00000
   Booting using the fdt blob at 0x40f00000
      Loading Device Tree to 40ef6000, end 40effc4b ... OK

This extra ca. 1 MiB seems to make the difference. Adding a bit more to
the kernel makes it fail on koelsch too, even without any output.

Doh, newer board, more stringent kernel size limitation...

Thanks!

Gr{oetje,eeting}s,
