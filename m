Hi Joerg,

No worries. As long as the driver gets in v3.16 (wink wink :-)) that's fine

ipmmu_tlb_invalidate() performs a read-update-write operation on the IMCTR 
register to set the FLUSH bit without modifying the other bits, while this 
function writes the FLUSH bit and sets all other bits (including the enable 
bit) to zero. The difference is thus important.

I might be able to (I'll need to check first though), but I don't really see 
what the use cases for sharing a common page table between separate IOMMUs 
would be. Could you please elaborate a bit ? Given that we're getting close to 
the v3.16 merge window, would it be acceptable to fix (if needed) that as a 
follow-up patch, as the driver is already usable as-is ?
