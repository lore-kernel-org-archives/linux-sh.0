No worries.

I don't mind submitting a v4.

My bad. It should be [flags] only. Pull-up and pull-down configuration should 
go through the renesas,pull-up and renesas,pull-down properties in pin 
configuration nodes.

On platforms where the GPIO controller hardware is separate from the PFC 
hardware, GPIOs are handled by the gpio-rcar driver. I've added DT support to 
gpio-rcar, the patches have been posted to the linux-sh mailing list and are 
in my tree at git://linuxtv.org/pinchartl/fbdev.git pinmux/3.9/dt.

I think there's no point in making the driver larger if CONFIG_OF isn't 
defined, especially for SH platforms.

I've dropped the other two.

I will also add a new patch that removes support for pdev->dev.platform_data, 
as we don't use it anymore.

OK I'll change that.
