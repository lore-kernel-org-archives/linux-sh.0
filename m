In that vein I managed to reproduce the warning using ap4evb_defconfig
and then enabled MMC. I have also verified that v5 does not produce
the same warning.

I chose this as I don't have a avr32 cross-compile environment
but I do have one for ARM and I know that ap4evb doesn't use DT.

I will update topic/mmc with v5.
