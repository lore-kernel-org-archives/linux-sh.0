MTD maintainers did not receive the above patch. Can you Cc us the
whole series next time.

BTW, I had a look at your branch and it seems the typo you're fixing is
actually not a type. Flags are *OR-ed* (with the | operator) to form a
valid combination of flags.

Not sure how you plan to merge these changes, but if it goes through
a single tree I'll probably need an immutable topic branch, because I
plan to change a few things in nand_base.c nand.h for the next release.
