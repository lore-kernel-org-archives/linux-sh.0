OK.

So you think I should add 'and must not contain "simple-bus"'?

The clocks are highly platform-dependent. Hence the exact expectations
belong in the binding documentation for the clock provider (and possibly
the PM domain provider, too).

This is indeed not about generic programmable clock generators, but about
clocks that are used solely to start/stop a hardware module by (un)gating
a functional clock.

If the bus controller is clocked from a generic programmable clock generator,
it would need its own driver to configure e.g. the clock frequency, which
could need more information from DT. This is not covered by "simple-pm-bus".

Thanks for your comments!
