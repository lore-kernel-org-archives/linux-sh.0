I have queued up the above patches for v4.3.

As the above patches are sh-pfc patches they would typically
be steered through Linus's tree via Laurent. If they wish
to take that path then I'm happy for this to be attached:

Acked-by: Simon Horman <horms+renesas@verge.net.au>

FWIW the above path is the one that the removal of mackerel/sh7372 took.

Alternatively, I am happy to take the above sh-pfc patches through
my tree but I would like to do so with an Ack from at least Linus.
