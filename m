Hi Olof, Hi Arnd,

please consider the following enhancement to the KZM-A9-GT board by
from Morimoto-san for inclusion in 3.7.

* This pull request is based on the devel branch of
  git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/linusw/linux-gpio.git
  which is based on v3.6-rc2.

  This is to satisfy compile-time dependencies.
  Please let me know if you would like this handled a different way.

* This and a previous pull request,
  "Renesas ARM-based SoC: KZM-9A-GT for 3.7", both touch board-kzm9g.c
  but I do not believe there is a conflict.

  Please let me know if you would like this handled a different way.
