Hello,

This patch series combines the sh-sci and related arch/ changes from the
following previously posted series.

[PATCH 0/2] serial: sh-sci: Prepare for CCF migration
[PATCH v3 00/29] Add OF support to the sh-sci serial port driver
[PATCH 00/16] sh-sci: Remove unnecessary fields from platform data

The patches have been rebased on top of renesas-devel-v3.13-rc2-20131205 and
reordered to have a single arch/ set between two sh-sci sets. Nothing else has
been changed.

Simon, I believe this set to be ready for v3.14. Greg has acked all the sh-sci
patches, and no comment has been received for some time now.
