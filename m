Not quite. While the driver only needs to have support for that and
DTS files should have that string in the compatible list, the other
strings can be present in the binding and earlier in the compatible list
to allow us to distinguish the variants later (without requiring changes
to DTBs).

What's this for, and how does this interact with the single clock listed
above?

THanks,
Mark.
