Ok I'll file one.

I've added a cleanup patch 1/3 and tackled the problems below as follows:

Oh yes, my bad. Fixed in patch 3 (formerly 2).

Here I have no idea how to fix it. dma_addr_t is a typedef to u32. How
could I possibly not loose the address space?

Here my smatch (git head version) doesn't complain. Still I switched
to unsigned int for indexing an array member and hope this solves the
problem. Done in new patch 1/3.

Fixed in new patch 1/3.

Same as above. Unclear how to solve.

Thanks for checking, I'll send out the new patch series in a moment,
