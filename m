Thanks, this seems to fix the intermittent "suspicious RCU usage" warnings I've
been seeing during suspend to RAM on r8a7791/koelsch, which has a dual-core
Cortex A15:

    Disabling non-boot CPUs ...

    ===============    [ INFO: suspicious RCU usage. ]

    -------------------------------
    kernel/sched/fair.c:4938 suspicious rcu_dereference_check() usage!

    other info that might help us debug this:

But I understand from the various other threads about this issue that this
patch is not going upstream, as it papers over the real issue?
