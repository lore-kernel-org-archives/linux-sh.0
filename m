And I think this is not the best solution. Those drivers essentially
still do the DT parsing themselves, just call some common helpers. I
think that should be well separated. The pinctrl driver just assembles
some data structure that has the information regarding custom properties
and the core handles the rest. I find the approach I have in the zynq
driver - which does it that way - more elegant. The only reference to
the core parser there is the function pointer to the generic node to map
function. And even that could probably disappear in the long term when
everything migrates to using the core parser and generic bindings.

Also, why does it make the driver simpler? In my zynq driver I only have
those mentioned data structs and nothing in regards of parsing the DT.
With drivers calling the parser you duplicate exactly that all over the
place in each driver. More code, more duplication. And I don't see where
things become simpler. The core becomes a little more complex, but well,
that's why it gets consolidated there, right?
