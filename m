Thanks, I can trigger using sysfs and your kernel configuration.

However, I assumed it also would work when the sceen saver kicked in.
I recall it being fbcon that controls the screen save, perhaps
something else. So just wait a bit and see if you also can reproduce
it. The console gets black but the power is still on...

Also forcing to go back to powered-on state (see below) doesn't work that w=
ell:
# echo 0 > /sys/devices/platform/sh_mobile_lcdc_fb.0/graphics/fb0/blank

It looks like we loose the panning information somehow. Most likely a
LCDC driver bug. Unless the driver callbacks are not being invoked as
expected.

Also, there is garbage in on the screen if FB_SH_MOBILE_MERAM is
enabled. The MERAM hardware is a 1.5 MiB memory block that can be used
as a LCD cache. It sits in the same hardware power domain as the
LCDCs. I don't think the MERAM software supports power down
unfortunately. Disabling MERAM support removes the garbage on the
screen.

Ideally to ARCH_SHMOBILE in arch/arm/Kconfig.

Yes, at least that's what I would do to keep the data together. I
don't care that much though, so feel free to implement it however
you'd like.

Please do!
