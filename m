I think you misunderstood the question: Laurent asked about
dmaengine_submit() (step 2) and dma_async_issue_pending() (step 3),
while your answer is about dmaengine_prep_slave_*() (step 1) and
dmaengine_submit() (step 2).

In personal conversations with technical people, I call myself a hacker. But
when I'm talking to journalists I just say "programmer" or something like that.
