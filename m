The problem is getting the data into clkdev in the first place for the
off-SoC devices.

Right, on the consumer side it's all sorted and works really well.  The
trick is on the provider side where you need to have the clock available
to be able to add the mappings for it.

Perhaps I'm just missing something about how this should all work -
actually, the regulator solution probably works fine here.  Pass an
array of mappings into either the driver or the clock subsystem and have
them add the mappings when the provider registers.  Whichever way around
should just be some hooks in the new subsystem.
