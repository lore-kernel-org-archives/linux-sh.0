My understanding from Olof is that it is fine to just make
an SH-mobile-wide decision.

Ok, so on the one hand ${vendor},${soc}-${unit} is more common.
But on the other hand because we use ${soc} in place of ${version} it
seems there are cases where it would make sense for use to use
${vendor},${unit}-${soc}.

I believe that the second hand trumps the first and we should go with
${vendor},${unit}-${soc} on SH-mobile as that should over all our
use-cases.

Does that sound reasonable to you?
