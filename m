A politely-worded email would have achieved just as good a response as the
insultingly-worded one.  You should reach for politeness first when dealing
with someone who might simply be misunderstanding your expectations of them.

Since I came in late, I've been reluctant to overrule driver maintainers
without someone asking me to do so explicitly (I'm happy to do it when
asked to).  I do sympathize with the frustration, though; let's move on.

I see.  So, if most patches are coming from your side, it seems that the
largest problem for the moment is that no-one except Ian can test your
patches against his hardware.  Do we think there's any chance of someone
(I guess ideally you but possibly me) getting hold of hardware with Ian's
MMC block in, for at least occasional testing before releases?

If not, is there any kind of split in the driver that we could use to try
to isolate changes more?

If not, I guess I agree that we just have to try and be clear about what
we're merging and the chance that we're breaking something in the process.

Yes, I expect we can start by merging many of the outstanding patches.
It looks like all except Arnd's six-part series can be merged via the
MMC tree, since the MFD changes have an ACK from Samuel already. 
I'll do that today.

Arnd, can I take just patches 1/2 from your six-part series, and have
you send the rest through the arch/ maintainers later?
