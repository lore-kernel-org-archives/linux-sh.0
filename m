(Again I'm rather nervous about all the device tree binding reviewing being
dropped in the lap of Linux subsystem maintainers and then expecting them
to be good and OS-neutral... Not your fault though.)

Then just use a boolean.

Just use a boolean oneliner then.

But I prefer that you define something really generic in
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/pinconf.txt for anyone using
generic pin config, then reference that.

This way we can have a more general config binding for any system
using generic pin config, mapping to the configs we have in
<linux/pinctrl/pinconf-generic.h>

The upside is that we could move the pinconf generic parsing code
to drivers/pinctrl/pinconf-generic.c and thus avoid code duplication.

We have so far not tried much to standardize pinctrl bindings, but
this would be a good opportunity.

I suggest these properties shall be defined in an include file using that new
include hierarchy, since you're using pinconf generic.

include/dt-bindings/gpio/gpio.h
Referenced by <dt-bindings/gpio/gpio.h> in the .dts[i] files.

In Linux-next you find how tegra machines and the imx6sl DTs have
started to use this facility for symbolic names.

And for that you should reference
<dt-bindings/gpio/gpio.h>

Use the symbolic names GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH and GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW
here.

#include <dt-bindings/gpio/gpio.h>
gpios = <&pfc 20 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;

Just
renesas,pull-up;

Or go for the generic pinconf binding I'm suggesting.
Then I guess it'd be something like:

pinconf-bias-pull-up;

(Quite readable.)

So these should be checked as booleans instead:

of_property_read_bool()

Though I much rather like this code added as helper lib
in pinconf-generic.c. Use drivers/pinctrl/pinconf.h for
API.
