Another variant has been proposed:

http://marc.info/?l=linux-arch&m4858482615574&w=2

Unfortunately I haven't got any feedback.

Linaro should use the new patch instead of the old one so that it gets
wider test coverage.

That's a valid patch but IIRC Russell wanted to cover the pmd as well. I
think it's better to include such patch if it makes a significant
difference in performance. I haven't done any benchmarks.
