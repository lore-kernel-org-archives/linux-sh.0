I was kind of taking a more simple approach, I were considering 
runtime_suspend as _one_ state. Right now there is no host driver having 
different levels of runtime_suspend state, if I am correct. But ofcourse 
that could be the future.

Moreover, I definitely do not think that a fixed timeout of 100us is 
applicable for all use cases, this must at least be configurable.

Before just skipping my proposal, I think you should know some more 
background to why I suggested this:

1.
mmc_claim_host is using mmc_host_enable, which kind of mean the same 
thing for a host driver as doing get_sync. Vice verse for mmc_release_host.

2.
When executing mmc/sd commands/requests the host must always be claimed 
(and thus the host is always enabled). But more important some mmc/sd 
commands must be executed as a sequence, without the host being disabled 
in between the commands (since a disable might mean that the clock to 
card gets disabled). To solve this, the mmc_claim_host is used, to make 
sure the host is enabled during the complete command sequence.

I happily continue this discussion, to see if someone more can break the 
idea about having get_sync in mmc_host_enable. :-)

Well, suppose a the host drivers start considering the PM QoS 
requirement, but never can fulfill the requirement of 100us for it's 
runtime_suspend callback function...

For you maybe power management is less important, but I doubt everybody 
else agree to that. It is a more complex balance I believe.

True, but that is not a good reason for adding more stuff to the mmc core.

By the way, I like to discuss with you so please take no offense from my 
comments. :-)
