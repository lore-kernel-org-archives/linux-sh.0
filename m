	Hi,

On some SoCs, the GIC may be part of a PM Domain (hardware Power and/or
Clock Domain).  Document the related optional DT properties.

This patch series:
  - Adds support for the PL390 GIC variant, as the PL390 has different
    clock inputs than the A9 MPCore GIC that is currently (incorrectly)
    described in various Renesas DTSes instead,
  - Documents optional Clock and Power Domain properties.

This will allow to properly describe later the relationship between the
GIC and the Clock and/or Power Domain topology on Renesas SoCs, and
prevent clocks from being disabled inadvertently.

This is v2 of "[PATCH] ARM: gic: Document Power and Clock Domain optional
properties" (https://lkml.org/lkml/2015/4/27/401).

Changes since v1:
  - Add "arm,pl390",
  - Add "clock-names" to DT bindings,
  - Document clock inputs on various GIC variants.

Thanks for your comments!
