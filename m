Hi Geert,

Thank you for the patch.

This looks good to me.

No need for a 0x prefix.

This looks good.

The @address is only mandatory to differentiate between nodes with identical 
names. As the node name is supposed to describe the device function, maybe we 
could rename it to clocks@ffc80030 ? As you modify the CPG node address above 
it might make sense to rename it to clocks@ffc80000 too.

I'm not advocating for a rename now, but as your patch touches the names, I 
think they should be fixed properly (or not at all).
