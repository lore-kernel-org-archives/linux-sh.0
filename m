I didn't tell you about this, but actually I created v5 patch
(it is under test stage now, I will send it to ML soon)
which doesn't add new DT property.

This v4 added new property for clock frequencies, and it was Geert's idea.
This is just my opinion, and I don't know this is good match for DT,
but, this clock frequencies range depends on each SoC, and we are already
using SoC based "compatible" on DT. This means we can (should ?) get each SoC
specific feature (which is not related to each platform/board) from "compatible".
Thus, v5 patch gets clock frequency range from SoC based "compatible".

Thank you for your help, please check my next v5 patch.

Best regards
