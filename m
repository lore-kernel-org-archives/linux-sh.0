    GP5_19 is also USB0_OVC_VBUS. It's used by PCI [EO]HCI.

    Yes, this error needs to be ignored (I wrote about that in the changelog 
but you cut out that part). If you disable the internal PCI driver, this error 
will disappear.

    The kernel log already tells you well about the source of error.
