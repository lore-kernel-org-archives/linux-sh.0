Hi Simon,

Thanks for your help picking up patches.

There are two things to consider:
1) Patch 1/2 needs to be updated to handle feedback from Sergei.
2) I'd like the series to be tested by Ulrich to see if they actually help!

I can resend 1/2 today or tomorrow and I think Ulrich can most likely
help us with testing sometime this week.

Cheers,
