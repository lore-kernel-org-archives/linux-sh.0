Ok, I've queued it up now (it was too late for -final, so we'll have to
rely on the stable backport later).

The bulk of the uart_handle_cts_change() callers do so with the lock
held, the only exception seems to be a few drivers that call it directly
from their interrupt handlers.

At first glance, the sci_tx/rx_dma_release() cases will probably need a
bit of reordering given that dma_release_channel() is taking a list
mutex, but I don't see too many issues otherwise. Having said that,
the whole DMA enable/disable path could probably be split up a bit with
individual toggle logic pushed down in to ->start/stop_tx as well as
->stop_rx for some finer-grained control. This would at least help make
the locking a bit more obvious.

Yes, this is something that needs to be done. I've tried to use the
driver as a module before in the past, and it does blow up rather
spectacularly in the remove case, this is hardly limited to the DMA
case though (and is also not a configuration most people are going to
ever really use, which is why we've largely ignored it thus far). The
PIO<->DMA transition on the other hand we're far more likely to hit,
especially if we end up exposing something like a userspace knob for
enabling/disabling arbitrarily for testing.

Most of the DMA cancelling looks it should be pretty easy to do via
->flush_buffer, unless I'm missing something. The amba-pl011.c driver
does just this for the dmaengine case.
