Hmmm... I get this warning with gcc 4.5, 4.6, and 4.8. Apparently gcc
4.7 is the only one that does not warn about this. Guess what I'm
using... :(

This is of course trivially fixed, but I have completely lost track of
the transmogrifications this patch has been subjected to. What's the
procedure?
