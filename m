I have queued-up the following. The code changes are identical to v2.
I have updated the changelog to the text above.


From: Magnus Damm <damm@opensource.se>

[PATCH v3] ARM: shmobile: r8a7790: Fix GPIO resources in DTS

The r8a7790 GPIO resources are currently incorrect. Fix that
by making them match the English r8a7790 v0.6 data sheet.

Tested with GPIO LED using Lager DT reference.

This problem has been present since GPIOs were added to the r8a7790 SoC by
f98e10c88aa95bf7 ("ARM: shmobile: r8a7790: Add GPIO controller devices to
device tree") in v3.12-rc1.
