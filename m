Clearly, this is not right.  Returning while leaving the mutex locked?
No.

The second issue is... with _just_ this patch applied, we end up with
"period" and "polarity" presumably initialised to zero, which means we
now end up with the above explicitly setting the period and polarity as
such.  Isn't that going to change the behaviour of this?
