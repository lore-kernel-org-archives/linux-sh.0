Ouch, sorry, no idea how I managed not to CC you, my apologies!

I'm not arguing against that. My point is the following: also Arnd's 
patches have to deal with the fact, that the filter function has to be in 
files, which will be compiled with SHDMA enabled or disabled in .config. 
He solves this problem by adding #ifdef's to each .c file. Whereas I think 
it's better to add just one such #ifdef to the header. The actual issue of 
DMA client driver dependency on a specific dmaengine controller driver is 
a different (though related) problem and should be addressed separately.

Thanks
