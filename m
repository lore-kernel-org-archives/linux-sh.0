If the decision is done basing on a Kconfig symbol it's an #ifdef.
That's not great but IMHO much better than a runtime decision.

Jeremy: I think it would be quite easy to convert your series to use an
#ifdef instead of the flag.  I don't want to do this (at least not
without asking first) because it's your series, not mine.  How should we
proceed?
