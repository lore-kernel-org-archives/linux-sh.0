I reconsidered about this.
Actually, I'm still wondering about this approach
because driver side doesn't have SoC specific matching table.
Of course SoC-specific name in .compatible can be backup plan for us,
but, we don't know it is 100% true.
(we might have new driver for some specific SoC, like R-Car DMA driver ?)

Adding to SoC specific compatible name in SoC side DTSes are no problem,
it can be backup plan.
but, we can't say 100% true that <driver>.txt has SoC specific name list.
because, driver doesn't care about it today, and we don't know the future

But, on the other hand, this kind of update patch can indicate to
kernel users that "this driver is under maintenance".
# we have many drivers which are not updated.
# 50% it is complete driver, 50% it is just non-maintenanced driver

So, I can say,

   Acked-by: Kuninori Morimoto <kuninori.morimoto.gx@renesas.com>

I can 100% agree if it is easy to understand
that listed specific SoC are just "working",
not "formally supported as SoC specific"
