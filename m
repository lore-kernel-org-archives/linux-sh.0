We _never_ know in advance what's going to happen.  An autosuspended
device may have to wake up at any time in order to carry out some work
-- that's true whether or not a system sleep has taken place.  IMO it
doesn't make sense to wake up an autosuspended device for no reason
other than that it _may_ need to do something; we should let it stay in
a low-power mode until we _know_ it has to wake up.

This example doesn't prove your point.  Sure, conditions may have
changed while the system was asleep.  They might also change while the
system is awake.  In general, whether or not the system was asleep
shouldn't make any difference -- to as great an extent as possible we
should strive to pretend that the entire sleep took no time at all (or
simply didn't happen).

So: Suppose the system had been awake when the access point
disappeared.  What would the wireless adapter driver do then?  It
should try to do exactly the same thing if the access point disappears
while the system is asleep.

You see?  The sleep should be transparent.

This is highly debatable.  I'd like to hear some thoughts from other 
people.

Clearly the behavior will need to vary among buses.  What's appropriate
for USB won't be appropriate for PCI.  Furthermore, the overhead of
waking a PCI device unnecessarily might be a lot lower than the
overhead of waking a USB device, so it might make sense always to
resume autosuspended PCI devices during a system resume.

Freezability doesn't matter; you can prevent items from being added to
the workqueue during a power transition just as easily regardless of
whether it is freezable or not.  In fact, it's easier if the workqueue
is freezable.  You don't have to prevent anything from being added; you
just have to cancel everything on the workqueue before unfreezing it.

One solution would be to have the bus types cancel their own pending
work items explicitly.  Another is to have two freezable PM workqueues,
one with automatic cancellation and the other without.

Well, here's something people discussed but which hasn't been
implemented (and may never be implemented).  A suspended USB keyboard
doesn't have enough power to turn on any LEDs.  So suppose a system has
two keyboards, and kbd-A is autosuspended when the user engages
CapsLock on kbd-B.  The input layer wants to turn on the CapsLock LED
on all the keyboards, which means it has to autoresume kbd-A.  But all
this action takes place in interrupt context, so an autoresume request
would have to be queued.

It _is_ difficult.  Right now USB ignores such requests, because the
threads that handle them are all freezable.  But the information isn't
lost; it is stored in the hardware and when the system wakes up the
requests will be seen.

Except for wakeup requests from root hubs.  If they arrive at just the 
right time then they are not stored in the hardware -- instead they are 
stored as work items on the ksuspend_usbd workqueue!  In essence, the 
workqueue serves as a software mechanism for saving IRQs which were 
delivered but couldn't be acted on.

That's why I don't want to erase the work items; it would be logically 
equivalent to dropping interrupts.

It looks like the only benefits provided by this patch are the
workqueue itself and the embedded delayed_work structure.  The ability
to cancel the work items (or prevent them from being added) during a
system sleep is questionable, as discussed above.  There isn't any
value added by the new functions or methods.

In short, it would be just as useful simply to add the delayed_work 
structure and export two PM workqueues, both freezable, with automatic
cancellation for one of them.
