Hi Laurent,

Your issue seem more related to a mmc protocol problem. Likely caused
by a bad patch for eMMC 4.5 poweroff notify. The patch I refer to is:
"mmc: core: Fix PowerOff Notify suspend/resume"

You may try to revert this patch and see if the same problem occurs for you.

We are trying to fix the issue inserted by the above commit in a patch name=
d:
"MMC-4.5 Power OFF Notify Rework", please have a look if you have the time.

Kind regards
Ulf Hansson
