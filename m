I have big concerns about this approach. First, it will only work if
a clock is available at deivce creation time. The conversion of irq
controllers to normal device drivers has already shown that is a bad
idea.

I also don't like that it tries to set up every clock, but there is no
guarantee that the driver will even use it. I would rather see this
behaviour linked into the function that obtains the clock at driver
.probe() time. That way it can handle deferred probe correctly and it
only sets up clocks that are actually used by the driver.
