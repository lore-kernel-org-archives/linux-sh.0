We can't really use the internal oscillator at the moment, it's one of
the things that is blocked on adoption of the common struct clk work. The
baud rate generator algo will likewise differ depending on whether it's
using an internally generated clock or not, which also makes a different
set of baud rates available.

My plan originally was to wait until the common struct clk stuff came
along well enough that we could provide a clock dynamically depending on
the target baud (or for avoiding cpufreq pre/post-change notifier
chains), but this obviously hasn't happened yet.

I think your idea for the abstraction with the phandle sounds like the
right approach, but we aren't presently in a state where we can handle
that.

Obviously they're used, otherwise they wouldn't be defined in the common
header. Whether they are used by these specific CPUs or not isn't
relevant, as there are plenty of cases where they are. grep harder.
