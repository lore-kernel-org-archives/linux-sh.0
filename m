That's really not how gpiolib is currently handled, unfortunately -
trying to transition over to that model in one patch would be way too
much.  

The goal here from that point of view is to make transitioning to
something more sensible easier by getting rid of the boilerplate code,
it makes doing the more invasive changes like you're suggesting much
easier as we're only dealing with the architectures that are actually
doing something.  It also means that we're able to immediately work on
turning on gpiolib on random architectures which is a definite win.
